misinfo,"in early 2016 , multiple web sites published breathless warnings about how social media users would “ never believe ” how dangerous it was to discard boarding passes . one such version reported : <PARA> the travel - related warning was reminiscent of the widely - circulated stories about the hidden dangers of hotel key cards and helping fellow airport travelers by holding their water bottles . in this case , the viral “ boarding pass ” items were mostly sourced from a far less alarmist source , a krebsonsecurity <MASK> from october 2015 . <PARA> the author of that piece explained that he had heard from a longtime reader , who said he “ began to get curious about the data stored inside a boarding pass barcode after a friend put a picture of his boarding pass up on facebook ,” before going on to document a complex series of steps he used to test his hypothesis : <PARA> the krebsonsecurity <MASK> described a process that was both time - consuming and laborious , and provided little information that would be truly useful to potential thieves . for example , the risks cited involved not the draining of bank account , but the potential resetting of the pin used to access frequent flyer miles . <PARA> after what appeared to be a moderate to intensive effort , all the information extracted in the provided example was described as “ the ability to view all future flights tied to that frequent flyer account , change seats for the ticketed passengers , and even cancel any future flights .” <PARA> many such operations with online accounts require the user to answer one of more security questions , and the answers to those questions are not something a potential thief would be able to glean from a discarded boarding pass . the <MASK> hypothesized that thief might be able a to answer a simple security question such as “ what is your mother ’ s maiden name ?” by gathering that information from a flyer ’ s social media accounts . <PARA> we contacted travel expert and consumer advocate christopher elliott for additional information on the <MASK> , who noted in reply that the risks expressed were more hypothetical than actual : <PARA> like elliott , we were unable to uncover any indication thieves were routinely ( or even rarely ) plumbing discarded boarding passes to steal anyone ’ s personal information , and much of the “ sensitive information ” the warning cited was printed in plain text on the front of the boarding passes . <PARA> a jetblue representative provided us with additional information about how boarding pass qr or bar codes worked . the representative affirmed the encoded information approximately matched the text printed on the pass and did not contain other sensitive information ( such as bank details ). however , he noted that sharing boarding passes to social media while en route presented a marginal risk of hassle to some passengers ( largely unrelated to the warning ). <PARA> a representative from southwest airlines also explained to us that no sensitive information was encoded into that carrier ’ s boarding passes : <PARA> among information generally contained on a boarding pass was a traveler ’ s confirmation code . armed with a confirmation code and a passenger ’ s ticketed name , mischievous individuals potentially possess the ability to cancel a ticket mid - journey . the southwest rep confirmed that by and large that held <MASK> across the industry and advised travelers to be mindful when sharing their itineraries to social media .",2016-03-02T20:33:02+00:00

no . <PARA> snarr ’ s facebook post describes , in very emotive , even disturbing terms , the fate that supposedly awaits the animals seen in the photo : <PARA> only 52 out of 211 animals ( 25 percent ) brought to the shelter that day were brought by their owners , to be surrendered . almost twice as many ( 102 ) were strays or lost dogs being brought to the shelter . and finally , more than 80 percent of dogs turned in to the barc shelter — for whatever reason — are not put down . <PARA> the shelter ’ s spokesperson provided us <MASK> showing that in 2016 , 80 . 4 percent of animals turned in ( either as strays , lost dogs , or by their owners ), were successfully adopted out , returned to their owners or otherwise kept alive . <PARA> ( there is a sliver of irony in this episode . juan martinez , who was in the photo that accompanied snarr ’ s inflammatory facebook post , was bringing a fostered kitten to barc for medical care . that kitten was once a stray , and could well have been turned in to the shelter by someone who once waited in line outside , just like those in the photo .) <PARA> the percentage of dogs euthanized was 19 . 6 percent . <PARA> since the total number of dogs turned in on 27 june 2017 was 154 , we can estimate that about 30 ( 19 . 6 percent ) of these will end up being euthanized . and since the total number of animals brought to the center ( including the medical and foster clinic ) was 211 — this means only around 14 percent will end up being put down . <PARA> in other words , the <MASK> likelihood is this : of the animals waiting outside the barc clinic at any given moment on 27 june 2017 — the day this viral photo was taken — the vast majority ( around 86 percent ) were likely not to end up being euthanized .",2017-06-29T22:55:06+00:00

misinfo,"castoreum ( or castor , not to be confused with the oil of a castor bean ) is a yellowish - brown , unctuous substance with a strong , penetrating odor which beavers secrete from castor sacs located in skin cavities between the pelvis and the base of the tail and spray when scent - marking their territory . ( the location of the beaver ’ s castor sacs means that castoreum also often includes a mixture of anal gland secretions and urine as well .) due to the beaver ’ s typical diet of leaves and bark , castoreum doesn ’ t “ stink ” as other similar animal secretions do , but rather has a musky , vanilla scent described at the perfume site fragrantica as a “ sharp spreading tar - like note that reminds one of the odor of birch tar or russian leather ” that when diluted in alcohol picks up “ more pleasant , musky and fruity nuances .” <PARA> because of its scent properties castoreum has long been employed in the perfume - making industry , and processed forms of castoreum have also been used as food additives , in the latter case primarily as enhancers of vanilla , strawberry and raspberry flavorings found in products such as iced tea , ice cream , gelatin , candy , fruit - flavored drinks , and yogurt . <PARA> however , the publicity afforded castoreum in recent years via alarmist food activists and “ where does vanilla flavouring come from ? and “ did you know ?” social media posts is vastly overblown : <PARA> the use of castoreum in common food products today is exceedingly rare , in large part because collecting the substance is difficult ( and therefore expensive ): <PARA> according to fernelli ’ s handbook of flavor ingredients , total annual national consumption of castoreum , castoreum extract , and castoreum liquid combined is only about 292 pounds , which works out to an average of less than a millionth of a pound per person in the u . s . compare that figure with the approximately 20 million pounds of vanilla naturally harvested from real vanilla beans every year . depending upon as scarce a substance as castoreum to flavor the ice cream and candy found on store shelves would create nationwide shortages of those items and drive up their prices beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest consumers . <PARA> in 2011 , the vegetarian resource group ( vrg ) queried five companies that produce vanilla flavorings about whether they used any castoreum in their products , and all five replied that they did not : <PARA> castoreum as a food additive is classified by the food and drug administration as “ generally recognized as safe ” ( gras ), and therefore food manufacturers don ’ t always have to include castoreum in their ingredients lists and may instead refer to it as “ natural flavoring .” however yucky that may seem , according to a 2007 safety assessment published the international journal of toxicology , consumption of castoreum poses no health risk to humans : <PARA> castoreum does still have a significant market even today , but almost exclusively for the use of the perfume industry , not the food industry .",2013-02-05T23:21:38+00:00
info,"the photographs displayed above were taken in 2005 and document a drive hunt ( commonly known as a “ grind ”) of long - finned pilot whales by residents of the faroe islands ( which are an autonomous province of denmark ), an activity that has long been a subject of international controversy . <PARA> the whale hunt has been a part of the faroe island culture for hundreds of years , but in recent decades the practice has increasingly become the subject of international protest and condemnation . supporters of the hunt maintain that the killing of pilot whales is “ an age - old communal , noncommercial hunt aimed at meeting the community ’ s need for whale meat and blubber ,” that the animals are dealt with so quickly that their pain is brief , and that whale meat accounts for a quarter of the faroe islanders ’ annual meat consumption . <PARA> conservationists charge that the hunts , which may take hundreds of whales at a time , are barbaric and pointless , that “ the practice is outdated , cruel and unnecessary for a place with one of the highest standards of living in europe ,” and that most of the whales go to waste ( either being left on the beach to rot or thrown back to sea after they are killed . <PARA> according to russell fielding , a geographer from the university of the south in sewanee , tennessee : <PARA> a faroe islands whaling site page describes such hunts unfolding as follows : <PARA> in 1986 the international whaling commission ( iwc ) introduced “ zero catch limits for commercial whaling ”; however , the iwc ’ s rules still allow for subsistence hunting in some parts of the world , and the application of their regulations to long - finned pilot whales is somewhat ambiguous since ( despite their name ) those animals are not whales proper ; they are ( like dolphins ) small cetaceans , and they belong to the same biological family ( delphinidae ) as dolphins . <PARA> in late 2008 , chief medical officers of the faroe islands advised that they no longer considered pilot whales to be fit for human consumption because the animals ’ meat and blubber had been found to contain too much mercury , pcbs and ddt derivatives . <PARA> as noted above , the faroe islands are an autonomous province of denmark and not a part of denmark itself ; essentially a self - governing country within the kingdom of denmark , with their own prime minister and legislature .",2009-11-22T08:00:00+00:00

misinfo,"although many folk beliefs take root worldwide , some remain peculiar to specific cultures . such is the case of the south korean conviction about “ fan death ,” a deadly fate said to await those who sleep nights in rooms where electric fans are left running . <PARA> there are three primary theories as to why leaving a fan running in a closed room overnight might kill a person . none holds up to medical scrutiny , yet that does not impede belief in them : <PARA> fans don ’ t chill air . they merely circulate it , which means the hypothermia theory doesn ’ t survive even the first hurdle of fan use causing a marked drop in room temperature , let alone the second of such a drop being enough to lower a person ’ s internal temperature from 37 ° c ( 98 . 6 ° f ) to below 30 ° c ( 86 ° f ). <PARA> both the suffocation and carbon dioxide theories fail on the fact that homes are far from airtight . unless a dwelling is purposely constructed to be airtight , sufficient air should leak into and out of it to prevent suffocation . <PARA> there are other , more loony , theories about what causes fan death . one asserts the fan ’ s blades chop up oxygen molecules , rendering such mutilated air unbreathable . another posits the fan converts oxygen into carbon dioxide . <PARA> no other culture appears to regard its electric fans with trepidation , yet the belief that these air circulating devices are capable of killing in their sleep even adult men is rampant among koreans . it doesn ’ t help that the korean media continues to report “ fan deaths ,” citing this form of demise every time an otherwise healthy - appearing individual is found dead in his bed . <PARA> as to how seriously the threat of fan death is taken in south korea , fan users there are cautioned to always leave a window open to counter the otherwise deadly effects . korea ’ s largest fan manufacturing concern , shinil industrial co ., issues warnings with its products telling customers to keep fans pointed away from people at night . “ this product may cause suffocation or hypothermia ,” the warning reads . the korea consumer protection board advises that “ doors should be left open when sleeping with the electric fan or air conditioner turned on . if bodies are exposed to electric fans or air conditioners for too long , it causes bodies to lose water and hypothermia .” many fans sold in south korea are equipped with timers so people don ’ t fall asleep with the units running all night . fan death fear is so prevalent that some korean drivers have made it their practice to open car windows a crack before operating their vehicles ’ air conditioners . <PARA> we can only speculate on where this belief came from . the first report of fan death dates to the early 1970s , a time when south korea was struggling to handle higher energy prices . it ’ s possible the government in place back then spread the <MASK> as a way of discouraging folks from running fans at night . <PARA> faith in fan death continues to run strong in south korea because people everywhere yearn for the comfort of easily - grasped explanations when bad things occur , and fan death provides koreans with that for a number of otherwise mysterious deaths . in any country , a handful of seemingly healthy individuals will be discovered dead in their beds , the cause of their demise not readily apparent . in south korea , a country that gets hot and humid in the summer , many homes will contain electric fans which , with their owners now dead , will be still running in the morning when the bodies are discovered . yet the one ( fan still running ) doesn ’ t cause the other ( sudden mysterious death ); the two are independent events . as to what actually causes these mysterious deaths , the smart money is on previously undiagnosed heart problems or drug or alcohol abuse . <PARA> the most telling argument against fan death is that people in other countries where fans are used overnight don ’ t die of it .",2008-09-05T07:00:00+00:00

( it ’ s natural though to confuse this boy ’ s death with the apocryphal <MASK> of an attempted kidnapping from a large store in which the child is drugged , his clothes are changed , and his hair cut and dyed , because that tale has been kicking around forever . one has to but hear “ child ,” “ abduction ” and “ store ” to bring that well - traveled urban legend immediately to mind . those interested in reading up on that legend should visit the kidnappings page .) <PARA> what follows is excerpted from a 1996 american society for industrial security ’ s publication : <PARA> child safety . as mentioned earlier , wal - mart has a child safety program that aims both to prevent abductions and to find children lost in the store . initiated in 1993 , the program is called “ code adam ” after adam walsh , a child who disappeared in a high - profile abduction case that received nationwide attention . the program establishes a series of steps that store associates can follow if a child is reported missing . <PARA> essentially , the program works like this : when a parent or guardian notifies an employee that his or her child is missing , the associate asks for a detailed description of the child , including name , age , hair color , eye color , approximate weight and height , and what the child is wearing . a shoe description is especially helpful , since shoes are difficult for a kidnapper to change quickly . <PARA> [ barbara ’ s note : looks like they ’ d heard that legend , too .] <PARA> after obtaining this description , the associate goes to the nearest in - store phone and pages “ code adam .” the associate then describes the missing child over the store intercom . the announcement could be something like : “ associates , we have a code adam . we have lost a five - year - old boy wearing a red shirt , blue jeans , and black tennis shoes . he <MORE> move to the next stage , searching the parking lot or other stores , questioning people , setting up roadblocks , and the like . <PARA> if the child is found with someone other than the parent or legal guardian , associates are instructed to call the police immediately or ask another employee to call the police and describe the would - be abductor . <PARA> while staff is expected to do everything within reason to prevent an abduction , associates are not expected to – and are instructed not to – expose themselves or the child to physical harm . if it is not reasonable to detain the suspected abductor or cause him or her to abandon the child , the associate is expected to get a description of the person , car type , license plate number , departure route , and related information . <PARA> “ code adam ” was named for adam walsh ., who was abducted from the sears store in hollywood , florida , on 27 july 1981 . his mother left him in the video games section for what she later said was five or seven minutes while she went to a different part of the store to buy a lamp . there are some reports that adam was ordered out of sears by store security as he and some others were making a disturbance and that his abductor encountered him outside the store . <PARA> only the child ’ s head has ever been recovered , no other body part . <PARA> i don ’ t believe the site of the child ’ s murder has ever been determined . <PARA> though the crime remains unsolved , convicted killer ottis elwood toole has twice confessed to it ( and later recanted both confessions ). if we believe he was adam ’ s killer and therefore accept his version of the events , he met the child in the store and lured him out to his car with promises of candy and toys . no dye job , no drugged child , none of the standard urban legend stuff . <PARA> but that ’ s a big “ if .” some reports place toole in a different part of the country at the time of the child ’ s murder , and there is also reputed to be another plausible suspect in the case . on the other hand , henry lee lucas ( toole ’ s lover ) <MASK> toole had shown him the shallow grave where he said walsh ’ s remains were buried .

misinfo,"consumers have been noticing for years that sometimes their pyrex brand cookware unexpectedly breaks during or shortly after use , often with such shatterings occurring in what seems like rather eruptive form . it is not unheard of for a pyrex dish to suddenly “ explode ” ( i . e ., break apart in conjunction with a loud noise ) while sitting in a hot oven or soon after it has been taken from one and is resting on a counter . <PARA> such breakage has to do with the nature of glass , which is the material used in the manufacture of this type of bakeware . when glass changes temperature rapidly , it experiences thermal shock , a process wherein different parts of the material expand by different amounts . sometimes glass vessels are unable to take the stress of that uneven expansion and shatter . <PARA> the october 2009 e - mail missive reproduced below suggests that pyrex brand glass bakeware products sold in recent years are unacceptably ( even unsafely ) susceptible to breakage in ordinary use , and that current pyrex products are inferior because the pyrex brand , having since been sold to another company , is now manufactured from cheaper materials : <PARA> first off , many consumers have come to regard pyrex brand glass bakeware as practically “ indestructible ” and have been utterly shocked to find that it can break in what they consider to be the course of ordinary use . however , all brands of glass bakeware are susceptible to breakage under certain conditions , especially when subjected to sudden extreme changes in temperature . different brands of glass bakeware have different usage guidelines , and what consumers consider “ ordinary use ” may not fall within those guidelines . ( particularly , many consumers have very different ideas of what terms such as “ freezer safe ” and “ microwave safe ” mean , ideas which are often not in accordance with government or manufacturer definitions .) contrary to strong consumer perception , neither pyrex glass bakeware nor any other brand is “ indestructible ” and should not be used in a manner that assumes it to be so . <PARA> the e - mail <MASK> above <MASK> that the writer “ googled exploding pyrex dishes and got ten million hits . exploding pyrex is very common .” as noted above , all glass bakeware is subject to thermal shock breakage ; when this type of sudden breakage occurs , especially when accompanied by a sharp , loud sound , it is commonly described by consumers as an “ explosion .” the reference to “ ten million ” search hits is a gross exaggeration , but many accounts of sudden breakage incidents involving pyrex brand glass bakeware can be found on the internet and elsewhere : chicago <MASK> wbbm - tv reported in 2008 that the consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) had received 66 complaints <MORE> to borosilicate glass : <PARA> some critics have maintained , nonetheless , that modern pyrex brand glass bakeware is involved in a disproportionate number of dangerous shattering incidents , that it is inadequately tempered , and that the company ’ s product instructions are insufficient . however , others ( including world kitchen ) have criticized such <MASK> as misleading , conjectural ones based on anecdote and misuse rather than on hard <MASK> and reliable documentation of manufacturing flaws . \ <PARA> in january 2011 , consumer reports published test results documenting that borosilicate glass bakeware was indeed more resistant to thermal shock breakage than heat - treated soda lime bakeware , but they acknowledged that their test conditions were “ contrary to instructions ” provided on the manufacturers ’ labels . <PARA> world kitchen itself <MASK> that it has received complaints from only “ a very small number of consumers ” about unexpected breakage , and notes that the cpsc has in fact found no safety issue with pyrex glass bakeware : <PARA> in a january 2011 <MASK> , consumer reports interviewed persons involved in 163 glass bakeware shattering incidents ( some of whom admitted that they were using the bakeware “ against the safety instructions for any brand , including the <MASK> version of pyrex ”) and noted that the cpsc had found “ 268 reports of [ emergency room ] visits for glass bakeware injuries ” in a sample of er visits from 1998 through 2007 but did not provide a breakdown of the brands involved or the conditions under which the injuries occurred ( while acknowledging that the <MASK> included “ injuries from glassware breaking when dropped ”). the cpsc estimated that a total of 11 , 882 such injuries had occurred nationwide during that period based on their sample size . <PARA> the e - mail <MASK> above also <MASK> in a tag line that “ world kitchen is not a usa company ,” and its reference to china has led many readers to infer that all pyrex brand bakeware is now manufactured in that country . however , world kitchen , which now owns such popular kitchenware and tableware brands as chicago cutlery , corelle , corningware , magnalite , pyrex , and revere , is a subsidiary of wki holding co . wki is headquartered in rosemont , illinois , and manufactures products in the u . s .

misinfo,"<MASK> : when embroiled in difficulty , even those who are not all that religious will at times find themselves appealing for help through the serenity prayer . this simple three - fold entreaty to the powers that be asks for three things : <PARA> serenity , courage and wisdom . yet there is far more to the prayer than that : its very nature teaches that any of those three qualities would not only fail to help at various times , but would even add to the problems at hand . application of the courage to change things in one ’ s life , for instance , would lead only to further heartbreak and suffering when applied to a quandary where the solution lies outside one ’ s abilities to influence matters . similarly , serenely accepting bad situations and treatment that could be altered only works to leave that person trapped and helpless within the current mess . and the wisdom to discern the one from the other is useless if not acted upon . <PARA> the prayer casts light upon this simple concept even as it counsels tranquility in the face of matters we can do nothing about and bold , decisive moves in the face of those we can . it serves to clarify the thoughts of many during times of trouble when all is confusion , suffering , and doubt in that it provides an answer — or at least a tool that can be used to help find an answer — to what can be done and what cannot . <PARA> it ’ s therefore natural to want to ascribe authorship of something so powerful to an important personage from the distant past . yet it was not penned by st . augustine ( 354 - 430 ), the first bishop of hippo and arguably the most influential of the early church fathers of the christian church . nor was its author cicero , boethius , marcus aurelius , thomas aquinas , francis of assisi , or thomas more . <PARA> this simple yet expressive prayer wasn ’ t laid down in antiquity by one of the most famous people of his day ; it was instead written in the early 1930s by reinhold niebuhr , an american theologian . while its wording has changed across the span of those eighty - plus years between then and now , even its earliest forms are clearly recognizable as the serenity prayer : <PARA> [ 1940 ] <PARA> o god , give us the serenity to accept what cannot be changed , <PARA> the courage to change what can be changed , <PARA> and the wisdom to know the one from the other <PARA> o god , give us the serenity to accept what cannot be changed , <PARA> the courage to change what can be changed , <PARA> and the wisdom to know the one from the other <PARA> time and widespread use have served to tighten its wording into its best known form ( as <MASK> in the example section above ), but at one point a longer version also existed : <PARA> god , give me grace to accept with serenity <PARA> the things that cannot be changed , <PARA> courage to change the things <PARA> which should be changed , <PARA> and the wisdom to distinguish <PARA> the one from the other . <PARA> living one day at a time , <PARA> enjoying one moment at a time , <PARA> accepting hardship as a pathway to peace , <PARA> taking , as jesus did , <PARA> this sinful world as it is , <PARA> not as i would have it , <PARA> trusting that you will make all things right , <PARA> if i surrender to your will , <PARA> so that i may be reasonably happy in this life , <PARA> and supremely happy with you forever in the next . <PARA> amen . <PARA> living one day at a time , <PARA> enjoying one moment at a time , <PARA> accepting hardship as a pathway to peace , <PARA> taking , as jesus did , <PARA> this sinful world as it is , <PARA> not as i would have it , <PARA> trusting that you will make all things right , <PARA> if i surrender to your will , <PARA> so that i may be reasonably happy in this life , <PARA> and supremely happy with you forever in the next . <PARA> amen . <PARA> the prayer was assisted in achieving a great measure of its renown through its association with alcoholics anonymous . these days , most aa meetings begin or end with a recitation of the serenity prayer , an act that serves to further propagate its spread . as to how the prayer came to be taken up by that organization , after an aa member happened upon it in the new york herald tribune in 1941 ( where it appeared as a caption within a routine obituary ), co - founder william griffith wilson ( bill w .) had it printed on wallet - sized cards and included in every piece of mail leaving aa ’ s head office . as bill w . said , “ never had we seen so much a . a . in so few words .” <PARA> barbara “ wisdom of the aegis ” mikkelson",2014-07-14T07:53:44+00:00

only the red dorsal stripe distinguishes them . <PARA> redbacks are found everywhere throughout the australian continent , especially alongside human habitation . <PARA> only females build webs . their smaller , less brilliantly colored male counterparts often lurk to the side . <PARA> humans must be careful . the spider won ’ t seek out people to sting , but should a hand stray into her web by accident , a trip to the emergency room may be in order as the venom acts directly on the nerves . <PARA> only the female bite is dangerous , and their bites have caused some human deaths . <PARA> the redback possesses a potent neurotoxic venom . it does not hunt its prey , but instead waits for a tasty morsel to wander by and become entangled in its web . <PARA> once the prey - usually a walking insect - becomes enmeshed in the redback ’ s web , it ’ s wrapped in silk . when it ’ s time to eat , the spider bites down on its intended victim , injecting its neurotoxic venom . the venom paralyzes the insect , and digestive enzymes begin to dissolve the prey ’ s insides . <PARA> antivenom for redback spider bites has been available since 1956 , and no known deaths directly attributable to redback bites have been documented in more than fifty years since then , which makes this latest case in ireland quite a subject of interest . however , note that the victim ’ s wife , jeanne , <MASK> her husband didn ’ t die soon after being bitten by a spider ;

misinfo,"when economic conditions are tough and / or the price of gasoline rises substantially , the suggestion that already financially pinched consumers aren ’ t even getting a fair shake at the pump is enough to make anyone see red . so , it ’ s not surprising that the warning <MASK> below and its variations about “ cheating at gas pumps ” quickly gained widespread currency in april 2008 as gasoline prices edged towards $ 4 . 00 per gallon , and began hitting inboxes again during an ongoing economic downturn in may 2009 : <PARA> examples : <PARA> variations : <PARA> it ’ s difficult to verify whether some anonymous person in georgia truly encountered a malfunctioning gas pump one day in april 2008 ( and whether his report of same was accurate ), but the georgia department of agriculture told us at that time that the pumps at the <MASK> referenced in the <MASK> e - mail had been checked by that agency ’ s fuel and measures section in november 2007 and were re - checked ( in response to this e - mail ) in may 2008 , and in both cases they were found to be operating according to standards : <PARA> since this message conflates two distinctly different issues ( whether gas pumps accurately report the amount of gasoline dispensed vs . whether gas pumps accurately register the proper charge for the amount of gasoline dispensed ), we ’ ll address them by discussing some general factors involved in the dispensing of gasoline . <PARA> vendors of gasoline are subject to a variety of <MASK> and federal laws requiring them to maintain adequately calibrated dispensing equipment and calling for periodic inspections by government regulatory agencies to ensure that they are in compliance with said laws . however , this does not guarantee that every gas pump you might encounter will necessarily be accurate , for a variety of reasons : some agencies may not have the funds to regularly carry out required inspections at every location , regulators ’ equipment might itself be inaccurate , understaffed agencies may not be able to adequately enforce compliance with regulations , etc . <PARA> furthermore , instances of malfunctioning or improperly calibrated pumps are not necessarily indicators that a particular gasoline vendor is “ cheating .” such irregularities may be due to worn - out equipment which can be difficult to spot ( and is about as likely to cheat the vendor as it is the customer ), such as the common occurrence of worn check valves : <PARA> unfortunately , much of the responsibility for spotting such irregularities and reporting them to regulatory agencies falls upon consumers themselves , and it isn ’ t always easy for the average consumer to notice problems like the ones described in the above - <MASK> message . determining whether a particular pump is correctly reporting the amount of gasoline dispensed can be rather difficult , especially if the difference is relatively small — just about all consumers can do in this area is to be aware of how much gasoline their vehicles should take at various fuel gauge level readings and note whether the reported number of gallons they buy corresponds to this number . ( that is , if you know your car typically takes seven gallons to fill when your gas gauge needle is on the halfway mark , you should be concerned if a half - tank fill - up suddenly takes eight or nine gallons instead . note that you need to learn this system by trial and error : because gas gauge needles do not necessarily move at an even rate across the full range between “ f ” and “ e ”, you can ’ t assume that a car with a 14 - gallon gas tank will necessarily take exactly seven gallons to fill when the needle sits on the halfway mark .) <PARA> it ’ s much easier to determine whether pumps are accurately registering the proper charge for the amount of gasoline dispensed simply by multiplying the number of gallons you buy by the price per gallon . ( if you can ’ t easily do this calculation in your head , you can either use a calculator or employ the suggested method of noting the total dollar charge at the moment the pump reads exactly ten gallons dispensed .) but of course , catching this sort of problem is only possible if the pump is accurately reporting the amount of gasoline dispensed , which , as noted above , is usually much more difficult to determine . ( it can also be the case that gas pumps which test as correctly calibrated when dispensing , say , five gallons of gasoline may not necessarily test as correctly calibrated when dispensing smaller or larger amounts of fuel .) <PARA> for now , though , it ’ s generally the case that the retail gasoline industry has a number of other ( and bigger ) problems to deal with , and that consumers have not ( so far ) been very aggressive in reporting the problems they might encounter :",2008-05-04T09:01:01+00:00

misinfo,"net neutrality is the principle behind a set of federal communications commission ( fcc ) regulations enacted during the obama administration mandating that internet service providers treat all online platforms , content and users equally . simply put , the rules kept providers from setting fees and transmission speeds that favored some content sources over others . proponents say net neutrality rules ensure fair competition and guarantee unimpeded access to all legal platforms and content for all users . <PARA> current trump - appointed fcc chairman ajit pai has been critical of net neutrality ( also known as “ open internet ”), deriding it as an overly restrictive and unnecessary set of regulations that is akin to “ micromanaging ” the internet . he has long argued that removing the 2015 restrictions would benefit consumers and the economy . fcc commissioners voted in favor of pai ’ s proposal to scrap net neutrality on 14 december 2017 . <PARA> fittingly , nowhere are the consequences of repealing the open internet rules more hotly debated than on the internet . one of net neutrality ’ s more fervent defenders in congress , rep . ro khanna ( d - california ), tweeted the following on 26 october : <PARA> the graphic khanna used , a screen shot of a promotion on the web site of the portuguese telecom company meo , purports to illustrate one of the end - user scenarios net neutrality backers have long predicted would come to pass in the absence of such regulations : limited offerings of pre - selected apps and content packages , with add - on charges for each ( comparable to service bundles offered by cable tv providers ). want to view videos ? pay extra . want to use facebook and twitter ? pay extra . and so on . <PARA> khanna ’ s example was quickly seized upon by open internet advocates who shared the screen shot along with commentaries contrasting what some described as meo ’ s “ à la carte ” content menu with the “ all - you - can - eat buffet ” users are accustomed to under net neutrality . “ portugal doesn ’ t have net neutrality . this is what their internet looks like ,” read the headline of a typical post in this vein . <PARA> except portugal does practice net neutrality , and the graphic doesn ’ t accurately depict what portugal ’ s internet looks like overall . <PARA> the european union ’ s body of european regulators for electronic communications ( berec ) established net neutrality guidelines in 2015 . portugal is a member of the european union , so its internet providers must comply . <PARA> the service promoted in the meo graphic , “ smart net ,” is essentially a menu of add - ons to the company ’ s standard mobile data service plan . contrary to the way it ’ s been presented , it doesn ’ t limit users ’ access to particular apps or sites . rather , it lays out prepackaged options via which meo customers can add extra gigabytes of data usage to their mobile phone plans ( similar to vodafone ’ s “ passes ” offerings ). <PARA> meo defended smart net in a <MASK> to the portuguese news web site observador ( translation by google ): <PARA> portugal ’ s telecommunications regulatory agency , anacom , would not speak to the smart net plan in particular but told observador that “ the issue of network neutrality , zero - rating offers and packages with additives are topics under analysis at anacom .” <PARA> zero - rating is the practice of providing unlimited usage for specific content sources within an otherwise limited or metered data plan ( an example of this in the u . s . is t - mobile ’ s unlimited music and video streaming for mobile users ). <PARA> critics such as the electronic frontier foundation ( eff ), a nonprofit digital rights advocacy group , say such practices discriminate against content providers who can ’ t afford to compete in a “ pay to play ” environment and open the door to further preferential treatment . u . s . net neutrality rules , like those of the european union , don ’ t ban zero - rating outright but mandated case - by - case studies to determine if they had negative impacts on end users or open competition . <PARA> fcc chairman pai announced in february 2017 that the agency will no longer investigate instances of zero - rating , as , in his words , “ these free - data plans have proven to be popular among consumers , particularly low - income americans , and have enhanced competition in the wireless marketplace .” <PARA> although this means mobile internet users in the united <MASK> may indeed see prepackaged data usage add - ons similar to meo ’ s in the future , it is not a foregone conclusion that this is what internet access as a whole will look like in the absence of net neutrality laws .",2017-12-05T00:04:45+00:00

( i have heard variously the indianapolis colts , atlanta falcons , and the tampa bay buccaneers , among others , but usually it is a professional american football team .) he tries to sell them , but doesn ’ t get a nibble . he tries giving them away , but nobody will take them . finally , the day before the game , he goes shopping , and places the tickets on his windshield in hopes that somebody will pick them up . he remains at the store ( or visits several places ) for a few hours to give the tickets more exposure . when he gets back to his car , though , he discovers that , not only has nobody taken the tickets , but someone left two more ! <PARA> [ ducibella , 1998 ] <PARA> a man had a ticket to a recent home game . he parked his car and walked a mile to the stadium before he realized that he had left it on the dashboard of his car . racing back , his worst fears were realized . someone had seen the ticket , smashed his windshield — and left four more tickets next to his . <PARA> <MASK> : this legend about tickets to a woefully underperforming team ’ s home game attracting even more tickets to that event rather than themselves being scooped up and made off with by grateful fans has been around for dogs ’ years . it has likely been told of every sports team to have experienced multi - year slumps because it so perfectly captures what lies deep in the hearts of many <PARA> loyal fans who have season after season shown up to support their teams only to once again be disappointed : at some point in the exercise , the desire to finally give up on the bums and stay home begins to make itself felt . this is the quintessential tale of disappointed fans finding a way to express their feelings — their teams are so bad that not only can ’ t tickets to their games be given away , but the attempt to do so will only spark others who are equally as disappointed to fling theirs away too . <PARA> the second example above is an escalation of the basic legend : in that version of the tale , an anonymous disgruntled fan actually smashes in a car window so as to gain access to the seemingly rejected item for the purpose of leaving more tickets with it . <PARA> oddly , at times this legend is manifested in non - sports versions too , as in the following example from 2011 : <PARA> the drought of 1988 brought hard <MORE> is that every rancher got this idea , and soon there was a glut on the market . it was a lovely thing for the average consumer , but as the suicide legend suggests , it wasn ’ t quite so good for the ranchers . <PARA> one day , a clever rancher came up with a plan . he loaded several of his calves into a trailer , then parked it on the side of the road , with the ramp to the trailer helpfully propped up next to it . with such an easy setup , somebody was bound to steal those calves — and the insurance company would pay him what they were worth , which was considerably more than he ’ d get for them on the current market . <PARA> when he came back to check his trailer , there were two more calves in it than when he left . <PARA> the natural reaction was to sell some of their cattle — it ’ s not good for the long run , but you have fewer cattle to feed and working capital to buy it with . the problem is that every rancher got this idea , and soon there was a glut on the market . it was a lovely thing for the average consumer , but as the suicide legend suggests , it wasn ’ t quite so good for the ranchers . <PARA> one day , a clever rancher came up with a plan . he loaded several of his calves into a trailer , then parked it on the side of the road , with the ramp to the trailer helpfully propped up next to it . with such an easy setup , somebody was bound to steal those calves — and the insurance company would pay him what they were worth , which was considerably more than he ’ d get for them on the current market . <PARA> when he came back to check his trailer , there were two more calves in it than when he left . <PARA> while the “ left tickets ” <MASK> is usually told as a “ this happened to someone else ” yarn , every now and then a beleaguered fan who has for too long backed a dog will tell it as having happened to him . an atlanta falcons ’ fan regaled the audience of a call - in radio show in 1999 with his account of having once left four falcons tickets under his car ’ s windshield wiper and coming back to find “ eight or 12 more .” in 1998 , another caller to a talk radio show said he ’ d once left two st . louis rams tickets he didn ’ t need under his wiper blades , and when he got back after the game , five unused tickets had been added to the pile . <PARA> barbara “ fan clubbed ” mikkelson",-0001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00

misinfo,"it is an undeniable fact that much of the food we consume is animal meat . but even though most of us are familiar with the types of animals we typically eat — cow , pigs , chickens , fish — comparatively few consumers have much familiarity with the processes involved in animal food production : where those animals come from , how they ’ re raised , what they ’ re fed , the conditions under which they live , how they ’ re slaughtered , etc . animal rights activists often post pictures and videos online to try to call public attention to some food animals who live and die in appallingly inhumane conditions , but an item about the housing of calves raised for veal production , however well - intentioned , is woefully inaccurate : <PARA> what ’ s pictured here are not crates in which calves are imprisoned within an hour of their birth , condemned to spend their entire lifespans stuffed into little boxes that don ’ t even provide them enough room to turn around in order to keep their meat “ tender ” before they ’ re marched off to slaughter after only six weeks . ( veal calves are typically raised for 16 weeks , not six .) this photograph actually shows calf hutches that are used to house calves being raised for dairy ( not veal ) purposes , and those hutches provide plenty of room for calves to turn around and as well as attached runs so that the calves can spend time outdoors : <PARA> as a post on the heim dairy farm ’ s blog explained , dairy farmers house calves in hutches for the first eight weeks of their lives for several reasons , including to protect the calves from illness , shelter them from weather , and better monitor their development : <PARA> similarly , dairy carrie explained that housing of newborn dairy calves in hutches is undertaken for their own health and physical protection : <PARA> although the calf hutches come in different sizes , as can be seen here they typically provide plenty of space for a young calf ( or even two calves ) to move about and turn around comfortably : <PARA> the hutches also include runs that provide calves access to the outdoors and additional living space : <PARA> and they provide calves shelter against the elements and temperature extremes : <PARA> none of this is to say that the lives of dairy cows are ideal ones , that dairy cows are never mistreated , or that calves raised for veal purposes don ’ t sometimes endure cruel and inhumane living conditions ( including being kept in virtually immobile confinement in veal crates for their entire 16 - week long lives ). but the cause of animal welfare is poorly served by the propagation of misinformation such as the inaccurate and misleading photograph / text pairing seen here .",2016-03-30T21:30:40+00:00

misinfo,"<MASK> : in january 2015 a video ( published first to marketers ’ websites and then to youtube ) began to circulate online warning viewers about a slew of mysterious ailments caused by a ‘ vampire fungus .’ in addition to the clip ’ s pervasively vague <MASK> ( and comically ominous use of the theme song to zombie classic 28 days later ), the video produced confusion <PARA> among its audience because the term ‘ vampire fungus ’ is also used as descriptor for pythium oligandrum , an oomycete sometimes employed in treatments for athlete ’ s foot and nail fungus ( because it is a parasite that “ feeds ” on the fungi that cause these conditions ). but pythium oligandrum is not the subject of the circulating video . <PARA> now that we ’ ve identified what the ‘ vampire fungus ’ described in the video is not , pinning down what it purportedly is is another matter altogether . most folks whose curiosity was piqued by the tantalizing teaser <MASK> were forced to sit through a more than 20 - minute sales pitch about the horrifying effects of vampire fungus in order to find out what it might be . before viewers learned the name of this nightmarish infectious agent , they were instructed to check for signs of “ infection ,” including any body fat whatsoever , any sort of skin ailment , any joint pain at all , and a laundry list of exceedingly common things one might ordinarily chalk up to being alive . <PARA> appeal to vanity was very high in the vampire fungus video , and a significant portion of it was devoted to stern warnings about how the vampire fungus ’ unchecked progression could lead to sugar cravings , obesity , and weight gain regardless of one ’ s diet or fitness regimen . additional segments of the clip focused on how garden variety skin complaints are due to the skin ’ s “ dying ,” and aching joints are not the result of exertion or a known ailment but rather of joints “ dying .” a major takeaway of the vampire fungus video was that seven out of ten americans were both getting fatter and dying , and doing so faster than before . <PARA> before the big reveal was made , the video also hinted at a nebulous conspiracy between the government , food companies , and science - based medicine to keep people in the dark about this insidious vampire fungus . predictably , the video ’ s makers ( who embedded it in a format that disabled the ability of viewers to skip to the end without sitting through the entire pitch ) peddled a cure for vampire fungus the government and big companies are supposedly trying their best to suppress . <PARA> so what is vampire fungus ? according to the drawn out conclusion of the video , “ a candida ” ( or yeast ). you may recognize candida as the culprit behind candidiasis , more commonly termed a “ yeast infection ” or thrush . while inconvenient , temporary overgrowth of candida is easily diagnosable and treatable with antifungal medications or ointments . <PARA> in rare cases , invasive candidiasis can lead to more serious systemic infection in people with compromised immune systems . the centers for disease control ( cdc ) explains : <PARA> invasive candidiasis is a fungal infection that can occur when candida yeasts enter the bloodstream . once the fungus is in the bloodstream , it can spread to other parts of the body and cause infection . <PARA> invasive candidiasis is extremely rare in people without risk factors , but it is the fourth most common cause of hospital - acquired bloodstream infections in the u . s . in the general population , the incidence is 8 to 10 cases per 100 , 000 people . <PARA> invasive candidiasis is extremely rare in people without risk factors , but it is the fourth most common cause of hospital - acquired bloodstream infections in the u . s . in the general population , the incidence is 8 to 10 cases per 100 , 000 people . <PARA> invasive candidiasis is generally treated via intravenous administration of antifungal medications for several weeks . <PARA> the vampire fungus threat , however , is simply candida . overgrowth of the fungus can lead to a yeast infection ( which is rarely serious ), but it isn ’ t slowly killing 70 % of americans . candida has intermittently been blamed for a number of ailments ( including obesity ), but no real <MASK> suggests its typical effects amount to much more than what is commonly called a yeast infection .",-0001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00
misinfo,"for several years , alerts circulated online have warned about the purported dangers of cutting an onion and then cooking with that sliced vegetable the following day : <PARA> the earliest example of such a warning we ’ ve encountered came in that form of a missive that began circulating in march 2008 . <PARA> it was penned by sarah mccann , who writes online about food - related matters , including recipes , warning about the purported dangers of spoiled onions . ( the pen name “ zola gorgon ” is a play on gorgonzola , a veined blue italian cheese known for its strong flavor and distinctive odor .) <PARA> mike mullins of mullins food products had this to say about the tour of his company ’ s facilities that resulted in the internet <MASK> about food poisonings from onions and mayonnaise : <PARA> as to the content of the <MASK> , it is <MASK> that commercially - prepared mayonnaise is hardly the food poisoning menace it is widely believed to be . a study conducted by researchers at the university of wisconsin ’ s food research institute in late 1980 and early 1981 ( results published in the journal of food protection in february 1982 ) showed that mayonnaise actually inhibited the growth of some bacteria in food . its high acid content , gained from the incorporation of ingredients like vinegar or lemon juice into the product , slows bacterial growth . “ when you add the mayonnaise to your salad , you decrease the ph of that salad . it makes it more of a hostile environment for that bacteria ,” said michael p . doyle , an assistant professor of agriculture and life sciences at the university . salt in the condiment also works to prevent spoilage . <PARA> however , mayonnaise is still not a substitute for keeping food cold . also , homemade mayo , which is made from raw eggs , poses the threat of salmonella poisoning .

ready gmo crop seeds ) with rising rates of autism . children with autism have biomarkers indicative of excessive glyphosate , including zinc and iron deficiency , low serum sulfate , seizures , and mitochondrial disorder . <PARA> the <MASK> conflated a number of unrelated <MASK> and beliefs about autism and its causes , jumping from pesticides to vaccines and back again in the course of its travels . a usda report issued in december 2014 about acceptable levels of pesticides ( that made no mention at all of autism ) was among the cited material : <PARA> in addition , as we have previously reported , the number of adverse reactions from vaccines can be correlated as well with autism , though seneff says it doesn ’ t correlate quite as closely as with roundup . the same correlations between applications of glyphosate and autism show up in deaths from senility . <PARA> of course , autism is a complex problem with many potential causes . dr . seneff ’ <MORE> foundations . <PARA> regarding autism rates in 2025 , the “ 50 percent of children ” estimate looks to be a rudimentary extrapolation of an apparent uptick in autism diagnoses in recent years . particularly if the cause of such an uptick is improvements in screening and access to diagnostics , it ’ s just as likely the rate would plateau or even dip in the near future when considered by itself . no explanation was proffered ( in the <MASK> , at least ) to justify an affirmative belief the prevalence of autism would rise so drastically ( and by that logic we might assume that by 2050 , 125 percent of the population will be diagnosed with autism ). <PARA> even disregarding the sloppy mathematics , the <MASK> ’ s very basis ( that glyphosate is the cause of a perceived increase in autism ) is unsupported . no mention was made of how glyphosate was isolated and shown to be a cause ( or even a factor ) in some or any cases of autism in the <MASK> . no autism spikes near agricultural facilities were described , nor was any definitive causative link at all cited by the <MASK> ( and presumably , seneff ) to back up the purported link between glyphosate and autism rates anywhere other than the imaginations of those making the <MASK> . the single link of merit made within the <MASK> ( to a usda report ) made absolutely no mention of autism at all but was misleadingly arranged to suggest a connection . <PARA> what the <MASK> seemed to hinge on largely was a correlation / causation fallacy : because [ unclear activity involving glyphosate ] occurred , a corresponding rise in autism diagnoses must be due to that unspecified issue with glyphosate . <MASK> of a similar nature have been dispelled with graphs like the following that show how difficult ( or simple ) it is to “ prove ” any one cause correlates with any one effect : <PARA> clearly the graph is tongue - in - cheek , but the sentiment is clear . without peer - reviewed reproducible research , any number of factors can be blamed for what looks like a rise in autism rates . in actuality , scientists in a number of relevant fields have been working full - time to find real and provable answers to that question . <PARA> whether educated or not , guesswork is only the start of research in epidemiology , and no published research exists to prove ( or even suggest ) a link between glyphosate and autism . no <MASK> was presented in the <MASK> to provide context for why glyphosate ( or gmos ) would be any more likely to account for the presumed increase than other environmental factors , and it appeared the only visible connection between the two was their inclusion on a graph presented at a conference of an indeterminate nature .",2015-01-07T04:39:24+00:00

info,"<MASK> : they may be “ raised pavement markers ” in the parlance of the dictionary - keepers , but they are botts ’ dots to anyone who drives over them . these rounded , raised plastic , ceramic , or polyester domes that serve to mark off freeway lanes are almost exclusively known by their pleasing - to - the - ear nickname rather than by their more proper ( and descriptive ) designation . <PARA> botts ’ dots are named for their inventor , elbert botts , a chemist who worked for caltrans ( california department of transportation ) in the 1950s as chief of the highway - pavement division . they were designed to enhance painted lines used in designating freeway lanes . repainting these lines season after season was proving to be both costly and dangerous ( the more often caltrans workers were exposed to vehicles zooming by , the more often there would be a mishap ), thus an alternate solution was <PARA> sought . <PARA> caltrans experimented with better , more reflective , paint but was unable to overcome the substance ’ s inherent shortcoming of not being reflective enough in the rain or when a layer of water obscured lane markings after a rainfall . improved paint wasn ’ t the solution — it was time to think outside the box . <PARA> botts began to tinker with rounded lane markers , his work culminating in 1955 in the invention of what would become a ubiquitous part of california highways , the botts ’ dot . use of the embedded raised domes resulted in a reflective lane separation that was visible day and night , rain or dry . its inventor always swore inventing the dots was the easy part — much more challenging was coming up with the glue to hold them in place year after year . ( at first , botts favored attaching the dots to the roadway with steel spikes but soon realized a spike that shed its dot would become a hazard lying in wait of a plump unsuspecting tire .) <PARA> the glue was perfected in the early 1960s , but the first botts ’ dots weren ’ t installed until 1966 on <MASK> 80 around fairfield and on highway 99 near fresno . elbert botts did not live to see his brainchild make his name a household word — he died in 1962 long before any fame was associated with him . <PARA> a persistent bit of lore attaches to botts , that he sold his idea to caltrans and became a wealthy man by wisely insisting on payment of a small royalty per dot installed . that is <MASK> : botts was the head of the caltrans department charged with devising solutions to the marking of freeway lanes problem . this was no lone inventor slaving away in a basement laboratory who devised a killer app , sold it to a company in desperate need of it , and suddenly found himself living in the lap of luxury as the royalty checks kept rolling in . rather , this was a man who worked a 9 - to - 5 job at caltrans battling all manner of problems associated with pavement and lane markings . <PARA> botts ’ dots come in two types , round and square , and in several colors . most are white , center markers are amber , wrong - way markers are red , and fire hydrant markers are blue . on most multi - lane freeways , caltrans uses four white round non - reflective dots in a row , interspersed every 48 feet with a reflective square , along the painted stripes dividing lanes . <PARA> in 1997 , there were some 25 million botts ’ dots in california . they can last more than ten years on some stretches of roadway but in others have to be replaced after only a few months ’ wear . <PARA> botts ’ dots provide an additional benefit unforeseen by its inventor — driving over them produces a ka - thump ! ka - thump ! ka - thump ! sound that swiftly captures the attention of motorists drifting out of their lanes or off the highway . because of this , they are installed on the outer edges of roadways known for their incidence of highway hypnosis as well as on the lines dividing one lane from another . many a sleepy or distracted motorist has been saved from disaster by the alerting ka - thumps ! of a sequence of botts ’ dots under their wheels . <PARA> barbara “ dot common ” mikkelson",-0001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00

info,"in the summer of 2018 , many americans were alarmed to read about the phenomenon of young immigrant children , without free legal aid , having to plead their cases before a judge in deportation and asylum cases . for example , in a 27 june <MASK> , the texas tribune reported that : <PARA> this report prompted inquiries from multiple skeptical and concerned readers asking us if it was <MASK> . <PARA> the referenced practice does occur today and has taken place for years . we spoke with immigration attorneys who confirmed that immigrant children subject to deportation or asylum hearings are not entitled to court - appointed lawyers , and they recalled having represented clients as young as two and three years old . <PARA> background <PARA> in the united <MASK> , any defendant in a criminal case is constitutionally entitled to be represented by a court - appointed attorney at no cost if they cannot afford to hire their own . however , this constitutional guarantee does not extend to civil cases or immigration courts ( although in some <MASK> and some circumstances , <MASK> law does entitle individuals to free legal aid in civil cases ). <PARA> instead , those who find themselves before immigration courts , whether adults or children , have the right , if not always the wherewithal , to obtain legal representation from one of a number of non - profit organizations and law firms who work on a pro bono basis . <PARA> although defendants do not have a right to court - appointed free legal aid in immigration court , the federal government does indirectly contribute to their assistance . the office for refugee resettlement , which is part of the department of health and human services , contracts with the non - profit vera institute for justice , which in turn sub - contracts with more than a dozen organizations around the country to provide free legal representation and advice to immigrants facing deportation and other legal issues . <PARA> in april 2018 , during the same week that u . s . attorney general jeff sessions implemented the “ zero tolerance ” immigration policy , the executive office for immigration review — which oversees the u . s . immigration court system — reportedly informed the vera institute that these legal assistance programs were to be put on hold pending a cost - effectiveness review . <PARA> sessions later announced that the programs would not be paused , but a review of their costs would still be taking place . <PARA> numbers <PARA> according to <MASK> collected by syracuse university , 58 , 015 unaccompanied children ( i . e ., juveniles under the age of 18 separated from their legal adult guardians ) were subjected to deportation hearings in american immigration courts in 2017 . <PARA> that figure was 61 , 254 in 2016 , and 35 , 113 in 2015 . between 2005 and 2017 , <MORE> for the children argued that : <PARA> the 9th circuit court of appeals rejected the lawsuit in 2016 on a question of jurisdiction and rejected a similar high - profile lawsuit in january 2018 , leaving in place the <MASK> quo : thousands of children with no right to court - appointed attorneys in immigration court . <PARA> megan mckenna is communications director at kids in need of defense , a charity devoted specifically to advancing and upholding the rights of children in immigration policy . she told us that the youngest child the organization had formally represented in immigration court was just two years old . <PARA> no rules or guidelines currently in place establish a minimum age below which children can ’ t be forced to defend themselves in court , according to mckenna . the court does provide a translator , if necessary , but most protections and services for children are at the discretion of judges who can , for example , delay a hearing to give a child time to find legal representation but are not obliged to do so . <PARA> mckenna described the process as “ unforgiving ,” adding that “ they ’ re all coming for a very difficult reason . no child would come on their own , hundreds or thousands of miles , unless something was really wrong .” <PARA> the debate over whether children ( as opposed to adults ) should be entitled to taxpayer - funded free legal aid in immigration cases partially revolves around the question of whether children , as a category , are less capable than adults of both understanding their circumstances and the questions put to them by a judge , performing the logical processes required to put together an argument on their own behalf , and verbalizing that argument with sufficient clarity and impact . <PARA> in 2016 , jack weil , a u . s . justice department official responsible for training immigration judges , sparked controversy with remarks he made during a deposition in the f . l . b . v lynch class action case . weil suggested that three - and four - year - old children could be “ taught immigration law ,” although he later maintained that his comments had been taken out of context . <PARA> during weil ’ s deposition , aclu attorney ahilan arulanantham questioned him as follows ( page 69 ): <PARA> we posed a series of questions to the u . s . department of justice relating to the presence of children in immigration courts , including whether any rules prevented children with intellectual disabilities from being ordered to defend themselves , what the specific criteria are for a judge to determine whether a child is capable of functioning in court , as well as the number unaccompanied children who have been subject to immigration court proceedings so far in 2018 , but did not receive a response by press time .",2018-06-29T12:02:22+00:00

misinfo,"<MASK> : in 1990 , a clerk for a steinberg grocery store in eastern ontario discovered something in a pepsi bottle he at first mistook for a straw . a closer examination revealed the item to be a syringe , and the bottle was rescued from the shelf before it fell into the <PARA> hands of a consumer . the find was turned over to store management , who in turn brought it to the attention of health and welfare canada . health and welfare canada launched an investigation into the incident , and although they ultimately achieved no official resolution of the case , they reasoned the likely culprit was a disgruntled employee of the bottler , eastcan beverages of ottawa , ontario . the incident was not repeated ; no more syringes turned up in any other bottles . <PARA> in an eerie way , that 1990 find was the precursor to the 1993 pepsi syringe panic . once again , hypodermic needles and this particular brand of cola met up , but this time the confluence of the two was pyrotechnic . <PARA> in the space of two days in june 1993 , news stories about finds of syringe - laden cans of pepsi swept the usa . for a short time it looked like a widespread instance of product tampering was underway . the first report came on 9 june 1993 from an 82 - year - old man in tacoma , washington , who said he looked into a can of diet pepsi to see if he had won a prize and found a syringe . ( he had not noticed the hypodermic when he poured himself a drink from the can ; he found the needle the next day .) soon afterwards , similar reports flooded in from all over the usa . at least 52 reports of tampering in at least 23 <MASK> were ultimately made before this scare ran its course . <PARA> though most of the “ finds ” involved syringes ( a woman in portland , oregon , said she found two in a single glass ), the list of items allegedly recovered from pepsi , diet pepsi , and caffeine free diet pepsi cans included a wood screw , a bullet , a crack vial , a broken sewing needle , and a mysterious blob of brown goo . <PARA> pepsi and the food and drug administration soon ruled out product tampering as the cause of these “ finds .” it quickly became obvious the beverager was the victim of a spontaneous hoax . once the first find was publicized , a number of unscrupulous people who sought to cash in on it created a rolling wave of growing hysteria , as each news <MASK> prompted another phony “ find ” which in turn prompted another news <MASK> . those looking for a quick buck reasoned it would be terribly easy to coax a little money out of pepsi <MORE> . yet was it enough ? needle - find hysteria in 1993 was nothing compared to what it would be now , when every found hypodermic is presumed to be laden with the aids virus , but even so pepsi will long be remembered as the soft drink with a syringe . the bell of <MASK> could not be unrung , even had the media cooperated . <PARA> unfortunately , the media didn ’ t cooperate . as gail de vos points out in her 1996 tales , <MASK> , and gossip , accounts of obvious post - purchase can tampering never came close to achieving the same level of prominence in the press as accounts of the <MASK> horrifying find did . as an example , she cites coverage by the edmonton journal , which was typical of how many news outlets handled resolution of this news <MASK> : “ the first two <MASK> appeared in the front section of the paper but the final outcome was not considered of equal importance — hence its appearance in the e section !” <PARA> while the slogan “ if it bleeds , it leads ” holds just as <MASK> here as with any other news topic , one might just as rightly coin “ once it ’ s nary ’ d , it gets buried .” tidy , fact - filled resolution <MASK> that explain away previous misreporting just aren ’ t nearly as interesting to the public as headlines which scream “ beware of this lurking danger : it could happen to you !” the press know that , so <MASK> of such ilk get tossed deep into the paper where most folks won ’ t encounter them . <PARA> this escalates the problem of an increasingly hysterical public : uneven coverage leads folks to believe their world is fraught with lurking dangers . why should they not believe just that when the front page is filled day after day with one horrific <MASK> after another , yet the calm , rational stuff is habitually buried in the e section ? <PARA> the “ syringe in the pepsi can ” tale is a fine case in point of the results of this form of weighted reporting . <PARA> although most folks who were media - aware in 1993 remember news stories about needles found in soft drink cans , not all that many of them could now ( or even back then ) tell you the whole thing turned out to be a hoax , an attempt on the part of a number of miscreants to rifle the deep pockets of a large corporation . to the majority , the <MASK> will always remain “ bad guys hid needles in pepsi cans , and i could have gotten hurt ,” not “ scam artists tried to shake down pepsi by pretending to find tampered cans .” <PARA> barbara “ all that ’ s now remembered is the fizz ” mikkelson",2011-05-28T14:07:12+00:00

info,"<MASK> : it ’ s an immutable fact of television life that local <MASK> and cable networks typically run more commercials during the airing of syndicated series than broadcast networks airing first - run episodes of current series do , which requires the former to find ways to fit 30 - or 60 - minutes episodes into a shorter amount of air time . as well , the amount of air time given over to commercials ( by both networks and cable channels ) has grown in recent years , making it even more difficult to squeeze full episodes of syndicated series around commercial breaks : <PARA> the rise in commercials can be attributed to two factors : broadcast and cable networks are allotting more time for commercials , and advertisers are increasingly using shorter spots to hawk their products . <PARA> in 2009 , the broadcast networks averaged 13 minutes and 25 seconds of commercial time per hour . in 2013 , that figure grew to 14 minutes and 15 seconds . <PARA> this issue has usually been dealt with by judiciously cutting scenes from episodes when they air in syndication — sometimes to the dismay of fans who have purchased dvds of their favorite series , only to find those discs used the truncated syndicated versions of episodes rather than the <MASK> broadcast versions . <PARA> but there ’ s another way for <MASK> to fit the same amount of televised material into a shorter time slot , one which has left many viewers puzzled and annoyed . it was demonstrated in a video posted to the avs forum on 13 september 2013 , that the tbs cable network was airing sped - up ( or “ time compressed ”) versions of the popular half - hour sitcom seinfeld in order to fit more commercials into its time slot : <PARA> i lined up the windows as closely as possible so you can also see cropping . between that and the extreme speed increase , tbs is butchering a classic . <PARA> tech times has also noted that the change is especially noticeable in shows from the seinfeld era , which <MASK> aired with an average run time of around 25 minutes , while modern sitcoms such as the big bang theory have run times as short as 19 minutes : <PARA> back when seinfeld was <MASK> airing , the average run - time for a sitcom was 25 minutes . that was just how things were done : five minutes for commercials , 25 minutes for actual show . now , things are different ; shows run at around 21 or 22 minutes , with roughly eight minutes for ads . when it came time to run old seinfeld episodes , tbs was faced with a conundrum : how do you get extra ad time out of a show that aired 15 years ago ? <PARA> tbs ’ apparent answer was , in this case , to speed the entire episode up . that way , none of the show ’ s content would be cut , and the network would still get its ad time . <PARA> tbs has not confirmed that it has time compressed episodes of seinfeld in order to fit in more commercials , but the network does display an “ edited for time ” warning before some programs : <PARA> it should also be noted that while tbs may have sped up some episodes of seinfeld , it does not appear that the network does this for every syndicated series . some episodes may air as <MASK> intended , while others may have scenes added or deleted in order to fit time constraints .",-0001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00

misinfo,"a compilation health piece about the health - related differences between butter and margarine began circulating on the internet in june 2003 , often under the title “ butter vs . margarine ”: <PARA> eventually , the primary focus of the “ butter vs . margarine ” piece became the following preface that was later tacked onto it : <PARA> contrary to the <MASK> , margarine was not invented as a turkey fattener . it was formulated in 1869 by hippolyte mège mouriès of france in response to napoleon iii ’ s offering of a prize to whoever could succeed at producing a viable low - cost substitute for butter . mège mouriès ’ concoction , which he dubbed oleomargarine , was achieved by adding salty water , milk , and margaric acid to softened beef fat . by the turn of the century , the beef fat in the <MASK> recipe had been replaced by vegetable oils . <PARA> nonetheless , there was a fair bit of truth to the health issues the piece surveyed , at least at the time it was first circulated . according to the latest findings in the medical world in 2003 , margarine could increase the risk of heart disease , depending upon the type of fat contained in the spread . previously , the dietary villain in the development of coronary disease was presumed to be saturated fat , but newer <MASK> pointed the finger at trans fat ( also known as trans fatty acids ). although butter has its own set of dietary shortcomings , it does not contain trans fat . <PARA> in 1994 , harvard university researchers reported that people who ate partially hydrogenated oils , which are high in trans fats , had nearly twice the risk of heart attacks as those who consumed much less of the substance . several large studies in the united <MASK> and elsewhere , including the nurses ’ health study conducted by researchers at the harvard school of public health , have also suggested a strong link between earlier death and consumption of foods high in trans fat . <PARA> trans fats occur naturally in small amounts in some foods , including meat and dairy products , but most trans fats in the american diet are formed when vegetable oils are chemically changed to give them a longer shelf life . cookies , potato chips , baked products , and the like are particularly loaded with trans fats . <PARA> the food and drug administration , the national academy , the national heart , lung , and blood institute , and the american heart association all recommend consumers limit their intake of trans fat wherever possible . moreover , the federal government passed regulations requiring that by 2006 all food labels disclose how much trans fat a product contains . <PARA> back in 2003 we compiled the following comparison chart for various brands of margarine as they were then formulated . numbers given in grams refer to how many grams of each particular type of fat there are per tablespoon of that brand . ( a tablespoon of butter or margarine contains 14 grams .) numbers given as percentages represent the impact of one tablespoon of that spread on the recommended daily allowance of that substance . margarines sampled were of the “ tub ” variety . ( the same margarines in “ stick ” form had consistently higher numbers .) <PARA> because butter is an animal product , it contains cholesterol , amounting to 30 mg per tablespoon or 10 % of the usda recommended daily allowance . margarines , because they are non - animal products , do not . the preceding chart says nothing about which margarines contained trans fats ( or , if they did , how much ) because this information was not always included on product labels back then . <PARA> since the issuance of warnings and regulations about trans fats in the last few years , many margarine producers have reformulated their products . i can ’ t believe it ’ s not butter , for example , now ( in 2006 ) bears a notice on its label <MASK> “ no trans fat ,” and the amount of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat per serving has dropped from 4 . 5g each to 4g ( polyunsaturated ) and 2g ( monounsaturated ) per serving . <PARA> although a great deal of the information given in the piece is valid , one bit of intelligence is nothing more than hyperbole tossed in by the author in an effort to make his point more strongly . the <MASK> that some comestible is but a “ single molecule away ” from being a decidedly inedible ( or even toxic ) substance has been applied to a variety of processed foods : <PARA> these types of <MASK> ( even if they were <MASK> ) are essentially meaningless . many disparate substances share similar chemical properties , but even the slightest variation in molecular structure can make a world of difference in the qualities of those substances .

leaning occupy democrats facebook page posted a meme that read : <PARA> “ just when you thought the trump administration couldn ’ t possibly stoop any lower , education secretary betsy devos is now trying to eliminate all $ 18 million in funding for the special olympics ...” <PARA> the post linked to a detroit free press <MASK> that reported the following : <PARA> the department of education ’ s 2020 budget proposals did indeed call for the total elimination of “ special olympics education programs ,” a savings of $ 17 . 6 million , very close to the “$ 18 million ” <MASK> by occupy democrats . <PARA> the full list of programs marked for elimination can be found on page 49 of the department ’ s budget request and total roughly $ 6 . 67 billion in savings . <PARA> devos also proposed eliminating her department ’ s funding for the special olympics in the 2018 and 2019 financial year budgets , to the tune of $ 10 . 1 million and $ 12 . 6 million , respectively . on all three occasions , the explanation given for the proposal has been the same : <PARA> “ this program supports a directed grant award to a not - for - profit organization . funds are used to expand the special olympics and the design and implementation of special olympics education programs . such activities are better supported with other federal , <MASK> , local , or private funds .” <PARA> the proposal to eliminate the special olympics programs did not make it into the final versions of the 2018 or 2019 budgets . democrats in the house of representatives strongly opposed devos ’ $ 17 . 6 million cut for 2020 during her appearance at a 26 march hearing of the labor , health and human services , education and related agencies subcommittee of the house appropriations committee : <PARA> given that democrats have had a majority in the house of representatives since january 2019 , it is highly unlikely that devos ’ proposal to eliminate the special olympics programs will be implemented for 2020 either . <PARA> during the 26 march hearing , devos told the subcommittee : “ we had to make some difficult decisions with this budget ” and justified her proposal by affirming that , roughly speaking , the special olympics receives enough funding from other sources , saying : “ special olympics is an awesome organization , one that is well - supported by the philanthropic sector as well .” <PARA> in a press release on 27 march , devos outlined her rationale at greater length , saying : <PARA> special olympics inc . and its affiliates received a total of $ 15 . 46 million in federal grants during the 2017 calendar year , just under 10 . 4 percent of its total revenue of $ 148 . 7 million , according to the charity ’ s 2017 financial report , the most recent such document published on its website . <PARA> by contrast , individual and corporate contributions and sponsorships made up 46 percent of the charity ’ s revenue in 2017 , and direct - mail contributions provided 30 percent . <PARA> readers and viewers of some news reports on 26 and 27 march may have been given the impression that devos had proposed ending all federal government funding of special olympics , such as when msnbc ’ s andrea mitchell <MASK> that the education secretary had proposed “ eliminating all federal money — all federal money — from the [ 2020 federal ] budget .” <PARA> in fact , special olympics receives funding from at least one other federal agency , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ), which is overseen by the department of health and human services . <PARA> according to that department ’ s grant - tracking database taggs , the cdc provided special olympics inc . $ 62 . 6 million in grants between 2007 and 2019 , with $ 23 . 9 million being provided since 2017 , and $ 9 . 9 million in 2019 alone . that funding has largely gone to two projects : “ healthy athletes ” and “ inclusive health .” <PARA> the department of health and human services ’ 2020 budget request does not contain any mention of the cdc ’ s special olympics grants , nor any proposals to eliminate that funding . <PARA> we asked a spokesperson for special olympics to provide a breakdown of the funding it receives from federal government departments and agencies , but unfortunately we did not receive a response in time for publication . <PARA> it ’ s not <MASK> to say that devos proposed in march 2019 to put an end to all federal funding of special olympics . however , she certainly did propose , in her department ’ s budget request , to eliminate all the funding at her disposal , in her capacity as secretary of education — $ 17 . 6 million for special olympics education programs — and she then publicly defended that proposal .",2019-03-27T22:16:29+00:00

profile german politicians . on 19 march , carsten schneider , a high - ranking member of the social democrats ( one of two parties in the federal coalition government ) told the german news agency dpa that “ mr . grenell is a total diplomatic failure .” <PARA> the german newspaper der spiegel <MASK> free democratic party vice - chairman wolfgang kubicki as telling the agence france - presse news agency ( afp ) that foreign minister heiko maas should “ promptly declare richard grenell a persona non grata .” later that day , kubicki doubled down on his call for grenell ’ s expulsion , writing on his facebook page that : <PARA> on 19 march , kubicki posted to facebook again , this time <MASK> from <MASK> 41 of the vienna convention on diplomatic relations , which reads : “ without prejudice to their <MORE> is certainly noteworthy and newsworthy that he explicitly called for the expulsion of the u . s . ambassador to germany , a move which would cause a major diplomatic scandal and a serious rift in relations between the u . s . and german governments if it were carried out . <PARA> however , kubicki is not a member of the german government and was not speaking on behalf of the german government when he called for grenell to be expelled . indeed , it appears he may not even have been speaking on behalf of his own political party , the free democrats . in response to a news report about kubicki ’ s remarks , fdp politician alexander lambsdorff tweeted : “ this is not the position of the fdp . supreme calmness and an invitation to talk would be better .” <PARA> so the widely - shared <MASK> made by <USER> that “ germany is requesting the removal ” of grenell is inaccurate and a significant <MASK> of the reality , which is that one german politician , a member of the opposition and not the government , publicly called for germany ’ s foreign minister to expel grenell in march 2019 . <PARA> it is also worth noting that <USER> was incorrect in <MASK> that the reason for the expulsion request was “ because [ grenell ]’ s a nazi .” in fact , the person who made the request , wolfgang kubicki , stipulated that it was in response to what he described as diplomatic interference in germany ’ s internal affairs . <PARA> however , it ’ s <MASK> that grenell has in the past attracted criticism and calls for his expulsion , for what some german politicians presented as an overly interventionist demeanor towards germany ’ s internal affairs , as well as what appeared to be efforts by grenell to form alliances with right - wing politicians from elsewhere in europe . <PARA> in june 2018 , shortly after he took up his position in berlin , grenell told the right - leaning web site breitbart that he looked forward to ’ empowering ’ conservatives throughout europe : <PARA> “ at a sit -

misinfo,"<MASK> : we tend to think of albert einstein purely as a man of science , the towering genius of the 20th century who spent most of his life steeped in mathematics and physics while he probed the mysteries of the universe . but a less well known facet of einstein ’ s life is that he was also a gifted and enthusiatic violinist and pianist who often sought solace in music , both as a performer and a listener . indeed , he once asserted that had he not been a scientist , he would have been a musician : <PARA> einstein ’ s mother , pauline , was a talented pianist who brought music to life in the family home . albert began to learn the violin at the age of six , while his family was still living in munich . however , he toiled under unimaginative tuition until discovering the joys of mozart ’ s sonatas at the age of 13 . from that point on , although he had no further lessons , his violin remained his constant companion . <PARA> when einstein moved to aarau in switzerland in 1895 to complete his schooling , he seems to have devoted a good deal of his time to music . it is recorded that he worked <PARA> hard on the brahms g - major violin sonata in order to get the full benefit from a visit to aarau of the great violinist joseph joachim , on whose programme it appeared . just before his 17th birthday albert played at a music examination in the cantonal school . the inspector reported that “ a student called einstein shone in a deeply felt <PARA> performance of an adagio from one of the beethoven sonatas ”. in addition to his prowess on the violin , he also played the piano and , in particular , loved to improvise . <PARA> so although it ’ s not inconceivable that einstein might have been photographed noodling around on musical instrument , it is extremely unlikely that that instrument would have been an electric guitar . einstein was a violinist and sometime pianist ; there is no record of his ever giving the guitar a try . moreover , einstein ’ s musical tastes were decidedly conservative , favoring bach and mozart while eschewing contemporary composers such as wagner , so he almost certainly would not have favored any form of music that one would be likely to play on the type of instrument he ’ s pictured holding here . <PARA> in any case we don ’ t have to speculate about einstein ’ s musical interests , because this picture is clearly a photograph of the mississippi guitar legend and bluesman known as t - model ford , into which someone has inserted an image <PARA> of the famed scientist ’ s head :",2015-10-06T19:00:07+00:00

misinfo,"on 16 august 2015 , real <MASK> developer turned gop presidential hopeful donald trump proposed draconian new immigration policies as a plank of his candidacy ’ s platform . of the several strategies trump embraced , the most controversial was a challenge to the concept of birthright citizenship ( which stipulates that all individuals born within the boundaries the united <MASK> are considered u . s . citizens from birth , regardless of the nationality or immigration <MASK> of their parents ): <PARA> naturally , trump ’ s proposal ( like much of his campaign ) attracted a firestorm of controversy . on 18 august 2015 , trump debated fox news host bill o ’ reilly during that evening ’ s o ’ reilly factor program over the birthright citizenship aspect of his proposed immigration policy . o ’ reilly opined that a challenge to the 14th amendment wouldn ’ t withstand legal tests : that amendment ( adopted in 1868 as part of the reconstruction amendments dealing with the citizenship <MASK> of freed slaves ) holds : <PARA> trump ( who later told nbc the “ good people ” could swiftly return ) maintained he ’ d “ much rather find out if anchor babies are actually citizens ”: <PARA> among criticisms of trump ’ s plan were observations that trump ’ s first and third wives ( ivana trump and melania ) knauss trump are themselves immigrants . some surmised ( perhaps in jest ) that three children born of his marriage to ivana trump and one born to current wife melania knauss trump would be subject to deportation under the birthright citizenship portion of his immigration plan : <PARA> but the legal <MASK> of any given immigrant prior to achieving naturalization or permanent residency is a complex topic . similarly , determining the legal <MASK> of his first and third wives at the time of the births of four of trump ’ s five children is challenging . trump was a real <MASK> developer at the time of his first marriage ; and he was not nearly as entrenched in politics at the time of his third marriage ( and thus his wives ’ respective immigration <MASK> attracted far less attention ). <PARA> ivana trump moved to new york from her native czechoslovakia around 1976 and married trump in april of 1977 . their eldest child , a son named donald jr ., was born in december 1977 . it ’ s likely the trumps settled any lingering immigration matters during the time between their marriage and trump jr .’ s birth in late 1977 . more to the point : even if ivana trump had not yet been granted permanent residency in the u . s ., their son would be entitled to citizenship under trump ’ s plan because he was born in the united <MASK> to an american citizen father . <PARA> slovenia - born melania knauss trump moved to new york city ( prior to any relationship with trump ) in 1996 . while her citizenship <MASK> from that point in time forward was not publicly disclosed , she maintained a career as a model and did not marry trump until january 2005 . their son barron was born in march 2006 , more than a year after the knauss - trump wedding ( and again , within the united <MASK> to an american citizen father ). <PARA> it ’ s <MASK> that trump ’ s proposition has been widely decried as incongruent with the 14th amendment ’ s granting birthright citizenship to all individuals born inside the united <MASK> . it ’ s also <MASK> that trump ’ s proposal could easily be <MASK> as hypocritical to a degree , given that four of his five children were born to mothers who immigrated to the united <MASK> . however , since trump was married to all of his children ’ s mothers at the time of the children ’ s births , his wives would consequently be afforded stronger chances to attain permanent residency via spousal petition .

misinfo,"in the days immediately following hurricane irma making landfall in florida in early september 2017 , many floridians lost electrical power — including those with solar panels . shortly after the powerful storm hit , the alternative weekly newspaper miami new times offered an explanation as to why those with solar panels , who seemingly should be unaffected by a utility grid failure so long as there is sunlight , were also , quite literally , in the dark . <PARA> in a 14 september 2017 <MASK> , the new times reported that thanks to lobbying , the utilities company florida power & light ( fpl ) had so much undue leverage over when and whether customers could make use of solar panels that they were able to prevent solar users from accessing sun - based electricity in irma ’ s aftermath . the new times reported : <PARA> although the “ big corporate government / axis of evil ” narrative was too juicy for many conspiracy sites to pass up , floridians are not , in fact , mandated by law to connect solar panels to the power grid . utility providers are instead required to allow customers to connect their solar panels to the grid for “ net metering ,” meaning they can enjoy lower utility bills if their homes generate more power than they use , because excess power is sold back to the utility company . florida <MASK> actually makes it unlawful for any entity block residents from having solar panels . <PARA> further , fpl doesn ’ t “ mandate ” that solar panels power down if the grid goes offline in a crisis . this is a safety precaution and industry - wide standard put in place to prevent line workers from being electrocuted while restoring power during an outage — and it is not unique to florida . the “ mandate ” cited by the new times is in fact a guideline which reflects this standard and includes an important caveat . the guideline reads ( emphasis added ): <PARA> we asked patrick altier , owner of the florida - based energy company solar trek , to explain further . altier told us that floridians who have solar panels on their homes can use energy from the sun during a grid failure — if they purchase additional equipment to prevent volts of electricity from traveling through power lines and harming unsuspecting neighbors or repair crews . to illustrate this , he gave us two scenarios : <PARA> the reason many homeowners don ’ t have the additional equipment necessary to allow them to keep their power on when the grid is down is because of the purchasing cost , said mark bubriski , director of public affairs for fpl . however , if customers have installed a battery system , such as a tesla powerwall or an sma sunny island , they can use their solar panels safely during a grid failure . no laws or mandates prohibit them from doing so . <PARA> conspiratorial theorizing about living off - grid is not new and tends to be popular , perhaps because it plays on the always - present american distrust of both governmental and corporate overreach . that perhaps explains why the new times <MASK> struck a nerve — it reports , for example , that “ fpl is ... allowed to disconnect your panels from the grid without warning you . the company can even put a padlock on it .” it also reports that utilities companies can “ charge a $ 400 or $ 1 , 000 application fee for consumers who want to install systems more powerful than 10 kilowatts .” <PARA> these are not misleading characterizations , but they make mundane operations seem ominous , bubriski said . technically , fpl can shut off power without warning for safety reasons , such as in the case of a fire or other hazard . fpl can also padlock certain inverters on large systems with manual shutoff switches to ensure the only ones able to access it are fpl workers . he also explained that the application fees , particularly the higher ones , wouldn ’ t affect most customers because the tiered fees only come into play for systems twice the size of the average florida home . <PARA> that is not to say fpl hasn ’ t been criticized — and as with any topic of public interest , there are legitimate concerns to be raised . for example , some have criticized the speed with which fpl restored power after irma ( as of 25 september 2017 , all fpl customers who lost power during irma have been brought back online ). and fpl and the local industry at large have been dragged for drafting what critics call favorable legislation . these stories , however , aren ’ t as clickable as the big - government - big - corporate conglomerate robbing the american public of free energy , which may explain why that is the one that made national headlines despite its mendacity .",2017-09-26T02:05:34+00:00

( for simplicity ’ s sake , we ’ ll say “ four of five ” throughout this <MASK> because that ’ s the worst - case scenario , and the figure is representative of the results of some reports , including the most recent one we could find .) <PARA> in one 1985 study done by the u . s . drug enforcement administration on the money machines in a u . s . federal reserve district bank , random samples of $ 50 and $ 100 bills revealed that a third to a half of all the currency tested bore traces of cocaine . moreover , the machines themselves were often found to test positive , meaning that subsequent batches of cash fed through them would also pick up cocaine residue . expert <MASK> given before a federal appeals court in 1995 showed that three out of four bills randomly examined in the los angeles area bore traces of the drug . in a 1997 study conducted at the argonne national laboratory , nearly four out of five one - dollar bills in chicago suburbs were found to bear discernible traces of cocaine . in another study , more than 135 bills from seven u . s . cities were tested , and all but four were contaminated with traces of cocaine . these bills had been collected from restaurants , stores , and banks in cities from milwaukee to dallas . <PARA> a single bill used to snort cocaine or otherwise mingled with the drug can contaminate an entire cash drawer . when counting and sorting machines ( which fan the bills , and thus the cocaine ) are factored in , it ’ s no wonder that so much of the currency now in circulation wouldn ’ t pass any purity tests . <PARA> the average person need not fear that the money in his wallet will inadvertently get him high , or that the act of paying for his burger and fries at mcdonald ’ s will cause him to fail a random drug test . only those whose jobs call upon them to handle an extremely large number of bills every day need worry that enough cocaine is getting on their hands to be detectable . bank tellers or those who work in the soft count rooms of casinos , for instance , might need to consider the effects of this contamination , but not average folks — not even ones who occasionally carry a great deal of cash about their persons . <PARA> as to how much cocaine will be on a contaminated bill , the expert witness in that 1995 court case charted results from as small as a nanogram ( one - billionth of a gram ) to as much as a milligram ( one - thousandth of a gram ). the argonne national laboratory study revealed that the average contamination was 16 micrograms ( which is 16 one - millionths of a gram ). if you ’ re not quite sure how much a gram of cocaine is , picture the head of a thumbtack . <PARA> these are very small amounts indeed , a fact that should be kept in mind as we speed off to share this startling new information about drugs on our money with friends and neighbors . this is not the latest , newest lurking danger to our health and welfare , nor is it an apocalyptic sign that drugs are taking over . yes , drug use in our society is real , but it has yet to reach the proportions where four of every five bills in our wallets has been used to snort cocaine . that four of five bills might test positive only means that 80 % of our paper money has at some time come into contact with contaminated bills or counting machines . it takes only one bill to contaminate hundreds or even thousands of others , so the number of bills that have actually come into direct contact with the drug trade is far smaller than we might first assume upon seeing that “ four of five ” <MASK> marked as <MASK> .",2002-07-09T07:00:00+00:00

upon discovering a wire improperly placed in her purse , they murdered her . by all accounts , hoffman was a regular user of marijuana who sold small quantities to friends , and not a career drug dealer .",-0001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00

<PARA> it ’ s difficult to determine at this point whether phillips has deliberately misrepresented the nature of his service , whether he has been so vague and ambiguous in many of his descriptions ( unintentionally or otherwise ) that misinterpretations have entered his narrative , or whether he has tried to be accurate but may have just occasionally slipped up in his many , many hours of conversation and sometimes neglected to include the qualifiers about his service that he has used in many other videos and press interviews . nonetheless , at times it has certainly sounded as though phillips was trying to foster the impression that he had both served during the vietnam war and had been deployed to vietnam at some point during his service , even if he didn ’ t literally say so . <PARA> we note that veteran ’ s affairs ( va ), for the purposes of determining eligibility for va pension benefits , considers the vietnam era to be the period between 28 february 1961 to 7 may 1975 for those who served in vietnam , and between 5 august 1964 and 7 may 1975 ( a window during which phillips ’ reported service falls ) for those who served elsewhere . the military times noted that phillips had “ spent four years in the marine corps reserve and left in 1976 with the rank of private , or e - 1 , the marines said in a <MASK> providing his personal releasable information ,” but we haven ’ t yet been obtained copies of phillips ’ official service records to verify exactly when and where he might have served . <PARA> ( we note that an image purporting to be a copy of phillips ’ dd form 214 — certificate of release or discharge from active duty — has been circulated on social media , but that image has not yet been verified .)",2019-01-23T21:27:41+00:00

wing outlets such as breitbart and the washington times . these outlets and many others uncritically repeated speculative fears presented in local news segments , and they continued to be cited to justify fears of disease from immigrants in 2018 . it is therefore informative to look at the fears raised in these 2014 stories to see if they were justified . <PARA> a 10 june 2014 <MASK> in the washington times raised concerns that diseases “ of an even more serious nature ” than scabies could infect the united <MASK> ( emphasis on speculative language ours ): <PARA> breitbart ’ s coverage from 27 may 2014 raised <MORE> cited concerns that immigrants from central american countries were bringing zika ( one of the diseases attributed to immigrants in the 2018 immigration memes ) to the united <MASK> in 2015 . while pundits attempted to blame illegal immigration for zika cases in the united <MASK> , the numbers do not support such a conclusion : <PARA> in 2016 , 185 million legal northbound crossings took place at ports of entry along the 2 , 000 - mile border between the united <MASK> and mexico . by comparison , the number of migrants in the latest caravan ( 2018 ) is in the thousands . <PARA> another relevant point is that many of the maladies listed in anti - immigration memes concern diseases that are all but eradicated in the united <MASK> thanks to vaccination efforts . polio , for example , has been considered eradicated from the entire american continent since 1994 . <PARA> in fact , many of the countries in central america from which the migrants are attempting to flee have higher vaccination rates for diseases such as measles than the united <MASK> does . in 2017 , 92 % of children aged 12 - 23 months were vaccinated for measles in the united <MASK> . in mexico and honduras that figure was higher , at 96 % and 97 % respectively . el salvador and guatemala have seen a recent decline in vaccination rates , with 85 % and 86 % coverage in 2017 . regardless , the notion that these commonly vaccinated conditions are in wide circulation outside of the united <MASK> and therefore present in higher levels in border - crossing immigrants is dubious . <PARA> a measles outbreak in an arizona immigration detention facility occurred in 2016 , infecting both staff and detainees , but it did not spread to the general public . its peril to the u . s . staff stemmed primarily from a lack of vaccination on the part of the staff working there . rush limbaugh attempted to blame a different measles outbreak at disneyland in 2015 on illegal immigration , but that outbreak was exacerbated not by illegal immigration but by lower than average vaccination rates in southern california . <PARA> while the cdc does suggest some risk of communicable disease transmission across the southern border , they do not attribute it to illegal immigration , but rather to the high level of transportation across the border in general : <PARA> in short , while detained populations of people held in close quarters carry a higher risk for the transmission of communicable diseases such as scabies or tuberculosis within that population , no <MASK> suggests that those populations pose a health risk to the surrounding communities . efforts on the internet to make that risk appear acute do so by misrepresenting out -

misinfo,"to “ let the cat out of the bag ” is one of those sayings wherein meaning is instinctively grasped even if it ’ s difficult to coherently put into words why this is so . while this phrase is a widespread shortform for truth coming to light , there is nothing obvious about why a cat ’ s being released from a sack should have anything to do with a secret ’ s being revealed . ( even so , it ’ s a handy phrase to have in one ’ s linguistic arsenal , in that there ’ s no one word in the english language that conveys the revelation , deliberate or accidental , of information that was intended to be kept hush - hush .) <PARA> the most widely believed theory about the saying ’ s <MASK> asserts it has to do with chicanery practiced upon those purchasing livestock . according to its lights , unscrupulous sellers of pigs would hastily swap a cat for the porker that had been purchased and bagged for easier transport when the buyer looked away for a moment , with the duped purchaser discovering the substitution only upon returning home and letting the cat out of the bag . <PARA> although numerous etymology books tout this explanation as the phrase ’ s <MASK> , common sense should serve to dismiss it . for the duped livestock purchaser theory to be right , the seller ’ s deception would come to light only when the cat was let out of the bag . yet , bag or not , it ’ s nigh on impossible to mistake a cat for a pig . at very least , anyone this deception was tried upon would quickly conclude there was something mighty wrong about its porker long before he opened the bag to see what was going on inside . <PARA> housecats and pigs are not of comparable size , so a sack containing the one instead of the other isn ’ t going to fool a buyer , in that the filled bag is going to be a fair bit smaller than it was before the sleight of hand . even if a large cat were shoved into the bag in place of a rather small pig , due to the nature of the build of each of these types of critters , the weight is going to be badly off — since cats are rather loosely constructed compared to far more densely - fleshed pigs , the cat is going to weigh far less than the porker even when both animals are the same size . <PARA> cats also behave far differently than pigs . while a pig encased in a sack might squeal or oink as it ’ s carried home , a cat is going to spit , yowl , hiss , and meow . we think you ’ d have to search high and low to find anyone <MORE> the cat out of the bag ” to have as its <MASK> a practice of cats being surreptitiously foisted upon the unwary as pigs by crooked farmers , said fraud would have had to have been successfully run on so many that its denouement worked its way into the language ( and that via folks not figuring out they ’ d been had until they got home ). there weren ’ t that many fools in the middle ages : if there had been , the species wouldn ’ t have survived . <PARA> we suspect the duped livestock purchaser explanation was borrowed from the admonishment about not buying a pig in a poke , a saying that reliably dates to 1555 ( with its antecedent “ when a pig is offered , open the poke ” dating to 1325 ). that homily cautions against buying goods one has not examined ( as opposed to afterwards checking goods already examined and purchased to assure no one has covertly exchanged them for less valuable commodities ). <PARA> a second theory ascribes the <MASK> of the saying to the british royal navy , asserting the instrument of punishment used upon those errant in their duties or behaviors ( a whip called the ‘ cat of nine tails ’ or ‘ cat - o ’- nine - tails ’) was routinely kept in a red sack , thereby a sailor who brought to light the transgressions of another was “ letting the cat out of the bag .” however , no <MASK> documents that such whips were commonly stored in sacks , or that the phrase “ let the cat out of the bag ” was initially associated with maritime <MASK> or usage . <PARA> as to where the saying did come from , there is as yet no clear answer . possibly “ letting the cat out of the bag ” was always meant as no more than an entertaining mental image of the explosiveness of a confidence ’ s revelation — usually what is deliberately concealed is of a salacious or titillating nature , thus there are often huge elements of shock and surprise when the truth comes out , somewhat akin to the commotion raised by a frightened cat suddenly loosed from the bag that had imprisoned it . or it could have to do with a similarity between the behavior of both secrets and cats — once either is let out , they go wherever they want . ( in other words , private news that has been made public spreads far and wide , despite all efforts to keep it contained to a small circle of confidantes or even to silence it altogether .) or it could be that “ let the cat out of the bag ” was a line from a play now lost to us wherein the connection between moggies and sacks and secrets was all made clear to the audiences enthralled by it .",2010-08-08T12:05:00+00:00

( computerized death certificates do not record whether the patient died in a teaching hospital , but they do record the county of death , so researchers looked at the proportion of major teaching hospitals in each county .) counties containing teaching hospitals experienced a 10 % rise in fatal medication errors in july , whereas counties lacking teaching hospitals did not experience that spike . the lethal mistakes included dispensing the wrong drugs , overdoses , and accidents involving drugs or biological agents . <PARA> in a bit that didn ’ t come from any of the studies discussed above , the e - mailed item asserts : <PARA> surgeons aren ’ t necessarily at their best first thing in the morning : like other mere mortals , some are bright - eyed and bushy - tailed as soon as their eyes snap open but fade as the day goes on , others hit their strides no earlier than the afternoon , and others are everywhere in between . similarly , the day of the week doesn ’ t appear to affect the skill level of surgeons . <PARA> according to an october 2009 <MASK> in the journal anesthesiology ( produced by the american society of anesthesiologists ), there is no bad time of the day , week , or year to have elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery , thus one needn ’ t worry about being a thursday or friday operation . it had been postulated the crazy hours surgeons work would impart fatigue - related disadvantages to patients who underwent operations later in the week , yet that did not prove to be the case : results from surgeries performed early and late in the week and at different times of the day were all similar . the reason why coronary artery bypass grafting was studied was because that procedure is the most common heart surgery , and there are well - established protocols for it . the analysis was limited to elective operations because emergency procedures are inherently riskier and are often performed on patients that have additional medical problems . <PARA> yet being the first under the knife on any given day may confer certain advantages to the patient . being early on the day ’ s roster means one ’ s surgery will start on time , whereas patients booked later in the day may find their procedures pushed back as complications in the operating room work to make a mess of the day ’ s schedule . also , the operating room is at its cleanest prior to the first operation , a factor for those concerned about the risk of post - operative infection .",2010-07-05T13:07:56+00:00

misinfo,"in april 2019 , washington <MASK> sen . maureen walsh attracted local and national attention — and criticism — for remarks she made during a debate about legislation intended to improve nurses ’ working conditions . <PARA> on 19 april , the website nurse . org posted a widely shared <MASK> whose headline read : “ senator remarks go viral : nurses ‘ play cards for a considerable amount of the day .'” the <MASK> went on : <PARA> walsh did say , of nurses in certain hospitals , that they “ probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day ,” and she has since said she regrets having done so . however , she made her remarks in a very specific context , and was not referring to all nurses everywhere , despite the impression given in much subsequent commentary and reporting . <PARA> the walla walla senator was speaking during a washington senate floor debate on 16 april , on the subject of shb 1155 , a piece of legislation that would require health - care providers to give clinical employees uninterrupted meal and rest breaks during their shifts , except in emergencies . <PARA> more specifically , walsh was speaking in support of amendment 724 , which was put forward by her republican colleague <MASK> sen . curtis king . that amendment would exempt a certain category of hospitals ( critical access hospitals ) from the requirements of the bill . <PARA> critical access hospitals ( cahs ) are smaller , typically rural hospitals with fewer than 25 in - patient beds that are legally designated as cahs by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services . because they typically serve relatively isolated rural communities , they receive certain financial support and benefits from the federal government in order to ensure their ongoing sustainability . <PARA> walsh supported the proposed exemption of cahs from the meal and rest - break requirements in shb 1155 , arguing that staff there were not typically as busy as their counterparts in other hospitals , and therefore did not require such mandatory regular breaks . in the interest of completeness , here are walsh ’ s remarks in full , which can also be watched here ( beginning at around 9 : 10 ): <PARA> in a <MASK> sent to snopes , the washington <MASK> nurses association rejected one of the premises of walsh ’ s call for cahs to be exempted from the proposed new requirements , arguing that , far from being in grave financial danger , “ the majority of these small , rural hospitals are financially healthy and well equipped to implement shb 1155 ’ s patient safety standards ,” adding that : “ over the last four years of reports , the total net income ( surplus ) for washington ’ s 40 critical access hospitals is $ 208 , 657 , 776 , with an average surplus of $ 5 , 216 , 444 per hospital . <PARA> when one views walsh ’ s remarks in their full and proper context , it ’ s clear that her “ playing cards ” comment related specifically to nurses in cahs (“ those nurses ”). she was not <MASK> that all nurses everywhere spend much of their working days playing cards . <PARA> this is in contrast to the impression created by much of the subsequent coverage of her remarks . for example , nurse . org summarized her remarks as “ nurses ‘ play cards for a considerable amount of the day ,'” without reflecting that walsh was actually describing only a relatively small subcategory of nurses . <PARA> on 19 april , juliana bindas started an online petition on change . org that called for walsh to follow a nurse around during a 12 -

info,"found out a couple of things you might be interested in ! based on the above , easter can actually be one day earlier ( march 22 ) but that is pretty rare . <PARA> here ‘ s the interesting info . this year is the earliest easter any of us will ever see the rest of our lives ! and only the most elderly of our population have ever seen it this early ( 95 years old or above !). and none of us have ever , or will ever , see it a day earlier ! here ’ s the facts : <PARA> 1 ) the next time easter will be this early ( march 23 ) will be the year 2228 ( 220 years from now ). the last time it was this early was 1913 ( so if you ’ re 95 or older , you are the only ones that were around for that !). <PARA> 2 ) the next time it will be a day earlier , march 22 , will be in the year 2285 ( 277 years from now ). the last time it was on march 22 was 1818 . so , no one alive today has or will ever see it any earlier than this year ! <PARA> <MASK> : how to determine the date of easter , the annual christian celebration of christ ’ s resurrection , is something of a mystery to the average person . unlike most other significant dates on the western calendar , which fall either on fixed dates ( e . g ., halloween is always october 31st ) or on easily - reckoned relative calendar days ( e . g ., thanksgiving in the u . s . is the fourth thursday in november ), easter moves around from year to year in order to preserve its relationship to the astronomical phenomena ( i . e ., the season of the year and the phase of the moon ) that would have occurred at the time of the resurrection ( traditionally reckoned as having taken place in 30 a . d .). <PARA> in the modern era , easter sunday generally falls on the sunday following the paschal full moon ( i . e ., the first full moon of spring in the northern hemisphere , or the first full moon occurring after the date of the vernal equinox ). however , since astronomical observations are variable ( e . g ., the date of the full moon can vary <PARA> depending upon the location of the observer ), the date of easter is typically calculated from tables . we ’ ll dispense with an explanation of how to perform these calculations ( for the curious , such an explanation can be found here ) in favor of addressing the main points of the example <MASK> above . <PARA> the earliest calendar date on which easter can fall is march 22 , and the latest date is april 25 . easter therefore took place unusually early in 2008 , with its date of occurrence being march 23 . the last time easter fell on so early a date was 1913 , and the next time it will do so will be in the year 2160 ( not 2228 , as <MASK> in the example cited above — although easter will also fall on march 23 that year , it will not be the next such occurrence ). <PARA> seeing easter fall on the earliest possible date , march 22 , is an experience that has not been , and ( barring some remarkable breakthroughs in longevity ) will not be , witnessed by anyone alive today : it last occurred in the year 1818 , and it will not happen again until 2285 . <PARA> the odds are considerably better for witnessing a late easter . this year easter falls on april 24 , the second latest date on which that holiday can occur . many people are still around from the last time easter fell on april 25 , an event which took place in 1943 , and a good many people here today will likely still be around when easter next falls on april 25 , which will occur in 2038 .",-0001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00

misinfo,"the long and complicated <MASK> of the word “ negro ” in the united <MASK> took another bureaucratic twist in late 2017 , when <MASK> appeared with the shocking charge that trump ’ s white house was considering bringing back government use of the word . the left - wing , anti - trump web site truth examiner reported : <PARA> in reality , the situation is much more complicated that the <MASK> presents . in 1997 , the clinton administration approved the use of “ negro ” in federal data gathering , but a working group established by the obama white house and carried over into donald trump ’ s administration has repeatedly proposed ending federal use of “ negro ” as a racial category . <PARA> however , trump ’ s office of management and budget ( the white house agency responsible for setting these federal standards on data gathering ) appears to have stalled a final decision on whether and when to implement these changes , which would effectively bar the use of the word by federal agencies . <PARA> “ negro ” has lost favor as a racial category . it was widely used from the 19th century until the civil rights movement of the 1960s , when many in the black community began to reject the term as an offensive throwback to the jim crow era of segregation and oppression . <PARA> in the last half century , “ black ” and “ african american ” have almost entirely supplanted “ negro ” in popular usage , and as the term increasingly came to be seen as outdated and even offensive , it has gradually been eliminated from use by government entities . <PARA> in 2013 , for example , the census bureau ruled that “ negro ” would no longer be a category on census forms ; the united <MASK> army followed suit in 2014 . in 2016 , president barack obama signed a bill that amended two specific existing laws by replacing their use of the word ( along with other archaic racial and ethnic categories ) with “ african - american .” <PARA> more broadly , though , federal agencies are still technically permitted to use “ negro ” as a racial category in forms and documents due to a 1997 decision by the clinton white house ’ s omb , which set what are known as the standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity : <PARA> the ruling was based on recommendations by a special working committee established by the omb , which had earlier reported that using the category “ black or african american ” in federal data gathering would cover most individuals in that community , but that “ negro ” should be allowed to persist as an optional additional category because the term , in their words , “ may be favored by older blacks .” the report also concluded : “‘ colored ’ may be favored by some blacks in the south .” <PARA> although federal agencies are technically allowed to use the word as a racial category in data gathering , we could find no <MASK> that any of them do so . <PARA> the obama administration set up a new committee in 2014 to revisit these standards on racial and ethnic categories in federal data gathering . in september 2016 , the committee recommended removing “ negro ” from the standards ( along with “ far east ”), meaning the term would no longer be permitted as a racial category in any federal data gathering . <PARA> the proposals went out for public consultation , and in march 2017 , following the transition to the trump administration , the committee once again proposed removing “ negro ” from the standards . <PARA> the source of the <MASK> that the trump administration is “ considering ” the proposals is the fact that the omb has not yet announced its final decision on them . <PARA> npr reported that the decision was not announced when it was expected on 1 december 2017 , and the omb ’ s own march 2017 publication had expected it sooner than that , in order to give time for any revisions that might be necessary ahead of the 2020 census . <PARA> we asked the omb to clarify the expected date of their final decision and asked for an explanation of any delay there might have been , but have not yet received a response . <PARA> the apparent delay in issuing a final decision on the omb committee ’ s recommendations does not necessarily mean that the trump administration is considering not implementing them . <PARA> there are sometimes delays in final decisions on federal policy proposals and recommendations for innocuous logistical reasons . <PARA> sally katzen , who was centrally involved in the clinton - era changes to racial and ethnic categories as head of the omb ’ s office of information and regulatory affairs in 1997 , told npr : “ the objective in each instance is to arrive at the right decision , not at any old decision .” <PARA> in this matter , there is no <MASK> that the apparent delay is caused by opposition to ending the use of these racial categories . <PARA> whatever the trump administration might be considering , it is not considering “ bringing back ” the use of the word as a racial category in federal data gathering , as it is technically already allowed under the clinton administration ’ s 1997 decision . what does remain to be seen is whether trump ’ s office of management and budget will adopt the proposals of a working group first established by the obama administration and finally put an end to the use of “ negro ” as a racial category on federal forms .",2017-12-26T15:27:19+00:00

info,"the following is an excerpt from the july 1943 issue of transportation magazine . this was written for male supervisors of women in the work force during world war ii . <PARA> eleven tips on getting more efficiency out of women employees <PARA> there ’ s no longer any question whether transit companies should hire women for jobs formerly held by men . the draft and manpower shortage has settled that point . the important things now are to select the most efficient women available and how to use them to the best advantage . here are eleven helpful tips on the subject from western properties : <PARA> 1 . if you can get them , pick young married women . they have these advantages , according to the reports of western companies : they usually have more of a sense of responsibility than do their unmarried sisters ; they ’ re less likely to be flirtatious ; as a rule , they need the work or they wouldn ’ t be doing it — maybe a sick husband or one who ’ s in the army ; they still have the pep and interest to work hard and to deal with the public efficiently . <PARA> 2 . when you have to use older women , try to get ones who have worked outside the home at some time in their lives . most transportation companies have found that older women who have never contacted the public , have a hard time adapting themselves , are inclined to be cantankerous and fussy . it ’ s always well to impress upon older women the importance of friendliness and courtesy . <PARA> 3 . while there are exceptions , of course , to this rule , general experience indicates that “ husky ” girls — those who are just a little on the heavy side — are likely to be more even - tempered and efficient than their underweight sisters . <PARA> 4 . retain a physician to give each woman you hire a special physical examination — one covering female conditions . this step not only protects the property against the possibilities of lawsuit but also reveals whether the employee - to - be has any female weaknesses which would make her mentally or physically unfit for the job . transit companies that follow this practice report a surprising number of women turned down for nervous disorders . <PARA> 5 . in breaking in women who haven ’ t previously done outside work , stress at the outset the importance of time — the fact that a minute or two lost here and there makes serious inroads on schedules . until this point is gotten across , service is likely to be slowed up . <PARA> 6 . give the female employe in garage or office a definite day - long schedule of duties so that she ’ ll keep busy without bothering the management for instructions every few <MORE> <PARA> 7 . whenever possible , let the inside employe change from one job to another at some time during the day . women are inclined to be nervous and they ’ re happier with change . <PARA> 8 . give every girl an adequate number of rest periods during the day . companies that are already using large numbers of women stress the fact that you have to make some allowances for feminine psychology . a girl has more confidence and consequently is more efficient if she can keep her hair tidied , apply fresh lipstick and wash her hands several times a day . <PARA> 9 . be tactful in issuing instructions or in making criticisms . women are often sensitive ; they can ’ t shrug off harsh words the way that men do . never ridicule a woman — it breaks her spirit and cuts her efficiency . <PARA> 10 . be reasonably considerate about using strong language around women . even though a girl ’ s husband or father may swear vociferously , she ’ ll grow to dislike a place of business where she hears too much of this . <PARA> 11 . get enough size variety in operator uniforms that each girl can have a proper fit . this point can ’ t be stressed too strongly as a means of keeping women happy , according to western properties . <PARA> <MASK> : we ’ ve seen so many modern day forgeries of texts intended to remind us how cruelly we once treated other human beings ( slave consultant ’ s narrative ), remind us how much more <PARA> difficult life used to be ( 1872 rules for teachers ), or poke fun at earlier societal attitudes ( advice to young brides ) that we now naturally assume any such document to be phony until proved real . <PARA> the text <MASK> above is one such example . although we know full well in the 1940s women in the workplace were often patronized , insulted , harassed , and treated as second - class employees in ways almost no one would find acceptable today , we have a hard time believing that even if we once held the attitudes that promoted this type of work environment , no one ( even way back in 1943 ) could have been so crass to <MASK> them as baldly and condescendingly as in the <MASK> cited here . <PARA> however , this is a case in which , whatever experience might tell us , we can set our doubts aside , as the <MASK> <MASK> above is indeed real . it was written by one l . h . sanders and appeared under the title “ eleven tips on getting more efficiency out of women employes ” in the july 1943 edition of mass transportation magazine . <PARA> use the links below to view scanned images of the magazine ’ s cover and <MASK> pages .",2009-11-17T11:09:20+00:00

misinfo,"intermittently , <MASK> have circulated on social media holding that the united <MASK> government was found guilty in 1999 of conspiring to assassinate martin luther king , jr . furthermore , according to these <MASK> , the reason this relatively new information ( king was murdered on 4 april 1968 ) comes as a surprise to many is the “ mainstream media ” intentionally suppressed it after the government ’ s role in king ’ s death was exposed : <PARA> it ’ s common for exaggerated <MASK> to contain a few elements of truth , and that factor comes into play in this conspiracy theory <MASK> for a few reasons . one is rudimentary research would confirm the <MASK> ’ s basics ( i . e ., the verdict in a wrongful death civil action did allow that “ government agencies ” participated in a conspiracy to assassinate dr . king ), leading readers to believe the entirety of the <MASK> was factual . another is the shaky foundation on which the conspiracy theory rests is a matter of some nuance . as well , the gravity of the trial ’ s supposed conclusion , when contrasted with the relatively little public discussion of that addendum to king ’ s life , has lent credence to the belief the trial in question and its outcome were deliberately omitted from the news . <PARA> historical figures like martin luther king , jr . tend to be the subject of complicated conspiracy theories , particularly when they are vectors for widespread societal change . the man who was charged with king ’ s murder , james earl ray , confessed to the crime and pled guilty ; he then recanted his confession , hinted at a conspiracy , and sought to withdraw his guilty plea and secure a trial . however , any <MASK> made by ray about his guilt or innocence should be weighed against his strong incentive to be freed from prison ( where he died in 1998 ). <PARA> also at issue is the difference between ray ’ s guilty plea in 1969 , which avoided his undergoing a criminal trial , and the case cited by the <MASK> , which was a civil trial heard in 1999 . the latter ( king vs . jowers ) was a civil suit brought by agents of king ’ s <MASK> ( including his widow , coretta scott king ) against a man named loyd jowers , who <MASK> to have taken part in a conspiracy to assassinate king . in a criminal trial the guilt of the defendant must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt , but in a civil suit the plaintiff need only support his <MASK> with a preponderance of <MASK> to prevail . <PARA> loyd jowers was a memphis restaurant owner who inserted himself into the narrative about king ’ s death in the course of a 1993 television interview during which he <MASK> to have <MORE> new york times ‘ report of the verdict , the one - sided presentation of the case allowed for no other result : <PARA> the justice department also found the <MASK> presented in the civil trial to be lacking in credibility : <PARA> all of this is therefore a very slender thread on which to hang the <MASK> that the “ u . s . government was proved responsible for king ’ s assassination .” ( in the event , the verdict referred only to “ governmental agencies ” rather than the u . s . government specifically , a term that could include anything from local police to the cia .) and contrary to the <MASK> ’ s assertion , the 1999 civil case involving jowers was widely reported by major news outlets at the time ( including , as referenced above , the new york times ). <PARA> more to the point , however , jowers ( who didn ’ t even testify ) was the only named party in the civil suit brought by the king family , and the judgment awarded in that case was a paltry $ 100 , widely described as a token award to mark the trial ’ s outcome . no other parties ( including any branches or agents of the united <MASK> government ) were named as defendants in king v . jowers , and no identification was provided by jowers of the purported other parties with whom he colluded to assassinate king . by all accounts , the two main parties involved , the king family and jowers , had disparate goals served by the civil suit ’ s outcome ;

misinfo,"racial disparities have long been a contentious element of the united <MASK> justice system , with black and ethnic minority suspects <MASK> more likely than their white counterparts to be arrested and charged , and to face stiffer penalties , even in similar circumstances . <PARA> the sentencing project , a non - profit organization that researches and lobbies for fairness in the american criminal justice system , summarized the phenomenon in a 2015 study , writing that “ once arrested , people of color are also likely to be charged more harshly than whites ; once charged , they are more likely to be convicted ; and once convicted , they are more likely to face stiff sentences –- all after accounting for relevant legal differences such as crime severity and criminal <MASK> .” <PARA> from time to time , examples emerge which appear to shine a light on those racial disparities , especially in sentencing . one particular case re - emerged on social media in the summer of 2018 , which promoters <MASK> was a stark illustration of racial discrimination in sentencing . the “ i love africa ” facebook page was one of many social media accounts which posted a widely - shared meme comparing the widely disparate sentences of chase legleitner ( who is white ) and lamar lloyd ( who is black ) for similar offenses : <PARA> the clear <MASK> made by this meme and those who shared it is that with two similar sets of circumstances involved , only the differing races of the two men could account for their very different sentences . <PARA> the comparison between legleitner and lloyd was first brought to light by the sarasota herald - tribune as part of a 2016 series of <MASK> titled “ bias on the bench ,” about racial disparities in sentencing by florida judges . one <MASK> focused on the record of sherwood “ chip ” bauer jr ., a judge on the 19th judicial circuit in florida : <PARA> florida ’ s 12th judicial circuit court firmly rejected many of the <MASK> made in the herald - tribune ‘ s series , publishing a lengthy and detailed rebuttal . in march 2017 , the new college of florida published an audit of the herald - tribune ‘ s methodology , calling it “ deeply flawed .” in response , the herald - tribune published a detailed fact check of the <MASK> made in the new college study .; <PARA> this <MASK> will focus exclusively on the factual <MASK> made in the viral meme comparing the sentences given to legleitner and lloyd , and the underlying <MASK> that the vast discrepancy in their sentences was due to their differing races . <PARA> basic facts <PARA> so the meme has the basic facts right . the two men were charged with the same crime , in the same court , had an equal number of sentence points , and were sentenced by <MORE> conduct , cases in which the defendant was an accomplice to a crime and not a major participant in it , and instances of a defendant ’ s cooperating with prosecutors . <PARA> different facts <PARA> according to 19th judicial circuit court records which we obtained , the race of the defendant was not the only difference between the cases of legleitner and lloyd . during the 23 june 2011 sentencing hearing for legleitner , the defense attorney and the prosecutor agreed that he qualified for a downward departure in his sentence . <PARA> david lustgarten , the prosecutor , said legleitner had been “ contrite and remorseful ” and that his testimony had been crucial in convicting the “ real bad guys ” within the group that committed the armed robbery : <PARA> judge bauer accepted these recommendations and sentenced legleitner to time served , meaning that he walked free after his sentencing , having already spent 722 days ( just under two years ) in martin county jail . bauer explained his reasons for ordering a downward departure from the minimum permissible sentence by saying that “[ legleitner ] cooperated with the <MASK> to resolve current offenses ... the offense was committed in an unsophisticated manner and it was an isolated incident . of course , the defendant showed remorse and at the time of the offense the defendant was too young to appreciate the consequences of the offense and those are the reasons .” <PARA> these mitigating factors were not present in the case of lamar lloyd . in fact , lloyd ’ s crimes contained elements that would be considered aggravating factors , as the 12th judicial circuit pointed out in their rebuttal of the herald - tribune series : <PARA> the rebuttal pointed out that , according to a stuart police department arrest affidavit , lloyd and his co - defendant louissaint had caused a pizza hut employee to “ fear for his life ” before handing over $ 150 in cash , and that when the two men ( along with another man who was driving them ) were stopped , police found “ two young children inside the vehicle ... [ who ] were inside the vehicle during both armed robberies .” the children were aged two and five years old . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> whether the discrepancies between the cases of legleitner and lloyd amounted to “ monumental factual differences ,” as the 12th judicial circuit described them , is ultimately a matter of opinion , as is the question of whether those factual differences warranted such vastly different sentences . <PARA> however , it cannot be disputed that significant differences existed between the two cases which went beyond the race of the defendants , and in giving legleitner a relatively lenient sentence , judge bauer followed the recommendations of both the defense attorney and the prosecutor , and he fulfilled his obligations by citing the reasons for that lighter sentence .",2018-08-20T23:22:19+00:00
misinfo,"in august 2017 , several news outlets reported that public health authorities in the <MASK> of iowa had advised against serving certain alcoholic drinks in copper mugs : <PARA> iowa ’ s alcoholic beverages division did indeed publish an advisory bulletin on 28 july 2017 : <PARA> the bulletin goes on to explain that the food and drug administration food code prohibits food or drink with ph levels of below 6 ( that is , relatively acidic food and drinks ) coming in contact with copper at a licensed premises like a bar or restaurant . the reasoning behind this , according to page 485 of the fda food code , is that there is a slight but definite risk of poisoning : <PARA> the fda code adds that anyone serving beverages ( including water ) through pipes must also have adequate mechanisms in place to prevent copper from leaching into drinks . it also points out that while copper is an important part of the fermentation required to brew beer , too much copper ( above 0 . 2 mg per liter ) kills yeast , so the level of copper leached into successfully - brewed beer falls below what is toxic to humans ( about 3 . 5 mg per liter and above ). <PARA> the 28 july 2017 <MASK> by the iowa alcoholic beverages division does not contain new information , new research , or a new warning about drinking from copper mugs . it is effectively a reminder , in light of the recent popularity of the moscow mule , that iowa has incorporated the federal regulations contained in the fda food code . that code has contained the same restrictions on copper plumbing and containers , and the same rationale , since at least 1997 . <PARA> it ’ s clear that although copper is an important naturally occurring trace element , it can also be toxic to humans . it is also clear that toxic levels of copper can leach into food and water through both copper containers ( such as those used for acidic drinks like the moscow mule and other beverages ) and through copper or copper alloy plumbing . <PARA> however , what ’ s less clear is how much copper is enough to make you sick , and how likely it is that you ’ ll be harmed by drinking a cocktail from a copper mug . <PARA> in 1991 , the environmental protection agency established a “ maximum contaminant level goal ” for copper of 1 . 3 mg per liter of fluid ( page 130 ). according to the epa , the mclg is “ the maximum level of a contaminant in drinking water at which no known or anticipated adverse effect on the health of persons would occur , allowing an adequate margin of safety ”. a 1999 study in the journal environmental health perspectives concluded that copper levels above 3 mg per liter of drinking water <MORE> replied : <PARA> solioz emphasized that while the risk from typical consumption is probably low for most people , a small proportion of the population ( around 1 in 30 , 000 people ) have wilson disease , which causes an accumulation of copper within the body , and could potentially be harmed by consuming acidic beverages from a copper container . <PARA> while most people are able to effectively secrete copper , solioz said , those with wilson disease struggle to do this , so even the relatively low level of copper leached into a drink could make them sick . <PARA> solioz told us he was unaware of any research which specifically measured the rate of copper leaching in containers carrying beverages of various acidities , and over various time periods . we were also unable to find such research . <PARA> the closest thing to this that we could find was a short 1957 report published in the american journal of public health . this report described an outbreak of nausea , vomiting and diarrhea among nurses at a military hospital in 1954 . the nurses consumed cocktails at a party that had been sitting in copper - contaminated cocktail shakers for more than two hours before many of them became sick . dr john wylie , the report ’ s author , wrote : <PARA> the cocktail was reconstructed , yielding the equivalent of 179 mg of copper per liter . wylie concluded : <PARA> it ’ s very difficult to conclude anything from this about the rate at which cocktails might typically become contaminated in copper containers : this was a short and decades - old case report , not a scientific study ( which could have controlled for various possible causal factors ); the author does not make it clear whether he himself was present for the incident ; and wylie also suggests that the level of copper leaching in the cocktail was linked to significant damage to the container . despite these serious shortcomings , the 1957 report formed the basis of the epa ’ s 1991 decision that the “ maximum contaminant level goal ” for copper in drinking water should be 1 . 3 mg per liter . this recommendation remains in place in august 2017 . <PARA> we also asked iowa ’ s department of inspections and appeals for <MASK> on reports of copper poisoning in the <MASK> , in order to see whether there had been a spike in symptoms accompanying the increased popularity of the moscow mule , but we were told that the <MASK> ’ s department of public health does not track such reports . <PARA> iowa ’ s alcoholic beverages division , meanwhile , recommends that if bar and restaurant owners are going to use copper mugs for highly - acidic drinks like the moscow mule , they should use copper mugs lined on the inside with other metals like nickel or stainless steel .",2017-08-11T01:37:10+00:00

misinfo,"salt lamps , which are merely light bulbs of varying wattages placed within blocks of rock salt of varying sizes , have become an increasingly popular product in the alternative medicine scene and are marketed as “ natural ionizers .” an ionizer , in theory , produces ions , which are atoms or molecules with a net positive or negative charge caused by an uneven number of protons to electrons . <PARA> according a popular ( and representative ) facebook post about salt lamps , the product can positively affect your health in these diverse ways : <PARA> all the <MASK> described above rely on the singularly <MASK> assertion that a block of salt with a light bulb inserted inside will naturally emit negative ions . that argument , when intelligible , usually invokes some sort of interplay between the salt , which attracts water from the air , and the heat from the light evaporating that water , as described in a non - peer - reviewed 2010 paper in the pakistan journal of molecular biology : <PARA> this explanation has the great benefit of sounding scientific . who really knows how ions are formed in the first place or what will happen to blocks of heated salt rock , anyway ? one person with pretty deep knowledge on the topic is caltech professor of chemistry jack beauchamp , an expert in ( among other things ) the myriad processes that generate ions and the analytical methods used to detect those ions . <PARA> beauchamp was skeptical that a heated block of sodium chloride would produce ions ( any amount of them , positive or negative ones , let alone “ boundless amounts ”) but not so skeptical that he didn ’ t want to hook up the most popular salt lamp available from amazon . com to his lab ’ s quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer . this instrument , in essence , sucks in air from directly around the solid and analyzes the mass and charge of <MASK> captured by the instrument . here ’ s beauchamp description of what he did in his own words : <PARA> the structure aspect is important , says beauchamp . one way to get crystals to generate ions is to alter the shape of its crystal structure via temperature , something that can happen if a crystal structure is asymmetric . he points to a crystal called lithium tantalate , which changes its crystal structure when heated up in such a way as to create areas of high and low electrical potential when heated or cooled . this property allows it to generate an electric field that could , in theory , ionize the air around it . sodium chloride ’ s chemical structure is a symmetrical cube that does not have the capability to generate high electric fields in the vicinity of a crystal . <PARA> the bottom line , according to beauchamp and other chemists , is that <MORE> air . <PARA> a block of sodium chloride , which , again , does not produce any ions , does not have any mechanism for the flow of air or the trapping of the <MASK> in that air , and would therefore be useless as an air filtration system . this is , incidentally , why the sharper image ionic breeze line of products , despite actually producing ions , is complete bunk . <PARA> this <MASK> has existed sporadically in the scientific literature for decades , but ultimately is not supported by current science . a 2013 review of psychological effects attributed to air ions , which looked at 33 studies from 1957 to 2012 evaluating “ the effects of air ionization on depression , anxiety , mood <MASK> , and subjective feelings of mental well - being ”, concluded : <PARA> this <MASK> stems from research performed on laboratory rats who were under anesthesia and essentially pumped directly with high concentrations of negatively ionized air . it goes without saying that humans are not rats , and a that specifically designed laboratory ionization instruments produce a whole lot more ions than a salt lamp , which , not to drive this point home too much , they do not . <PARA> this assertion is perplexing because it is a ) unclear where that number comes from , b ) which ones they are , or c ) how these trace minerals would be released from the salt in a lamp and transported into your body . <PARA> it seems likely that the number and associated health <MASK> comes from a page on dr . mercola ’ s online store in which he is selling his own brand of himalayan salt ( supplies are limited !) ironically , mercola <MASK> himalayan salt to be “ the most pure ” while simultaneously suggesting its health benefits come from its impurities : <PARA> needless to say , the <MASK> listed on an advertisement for a product cannot be taken as peer - reviewed science . not that you need to even look that far . <PARA> this advertisement is for salt to cook with , which would provide a much more plausible route for those trace minerals to get into your body . unless you are licking your salt lamp , however , the only thing those impurities might do is impart its nice pinkish color . <PARA> incidentally , that nice pinkish color that glows once the bulb is turned on is the only thing you are going to get from a salt lamp . salt lamps may look neat , but <MASK> that they can do anything medically rely — fatally — on the <MASK> that the lamps produce negative ions and then further rely on a series gross simplifications or misinterpretations of science to argue that those negative ions ( which don ’ t exist in the first place ) could affect you in any meaningful way .",2016-12-22T20:58:58+00:00

misinfo,"most household air conditioning units work by using a vapor - compression refrigeration system . in such systems , a mixture of chemicals known as a refrigerant is contained in liquid form under pressure , and when that mixture is pumped into a region of lower pressure , it expands and changes phase into a gas , absorbing nearby heat before being pumped to a different location . the gas is then recompressed and this process begins anew . <PARA> the first widely used refrigerants were chlorofluorocarbons , also known as cfcs . in the 1970s , however , the scientific community determined that cfcs were building up in the earth ’ s upper atmosphere in a way that damaged the ozone layer , lessening the planet ’ s natural protection from some forms of solar radiation . in 1987 , 27 countries therefore signed a global environmental treaty called the montreal protocol to reduce substances that deplete the ozone layer . under this treaty , signatories pledged to reduce the use of ozone - depleting compounds ( such as halons and cfcs ) to below 50 % of 1987 levels by the year 2000 . <PARA> one of the most widely used replacements for cfcs were chemicals known as hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( hcfcs ), and this substitution largely made the phase - out of cfcs possible . unfortunately , many hcfcs , including hcfc - 22 ( a principal component of the trade name product “ freon ”) contribute both to global warming and can , to a lesser degree , serve to deplete the ozone layer as well . <PARA> for this reason , montreal protocol signatories agreed to accelerate the phase - out of these products in 2007 . in the united <MASK> ’ case , this meant that the environmental protection agency ( epa ) mandated no new hcfc - 22 - based air conditioning systems be manufactured or installed after 1 january 2010 , and the import or production of hcfc - 22 be completely halted a decade later . <PARA> newer a / c machines are required to use ozone - friendly refrigerants . the most common replacement for hcfc - 22 in the united <MASK> is r - 410a , which does not harm the ozone layer but is considered a greenhouse gas . <PARA> all of these changes , however , are being made on the production side of operations , not the consumer end . if you have an older air conditioning unit , you will likely find it becoming increasingly harder to service in the future , but you will not be required to replace it soon than you have to :",2018-07-19T23:40:37+00:00

( advanced directives are legal documents used to appoint an official representative to make health decisions in the event someone becomes incapacitated .) <PARA> the life news <MASK> is out of date , as a different version of the same legislation , house bill 4135 , was signed into law on 16 march 2018 . the primary purpose behind both pieces of legislation was the simplification and clarification of the form used to create advance directives . the advance directive debate in 2018 was indeed controversial , and the passage of house bill 4135 took place along party lines , but those debates were largely about how much power to give the committee charged with creating the new form and not about the cessation of life support . <PARA> most opponents of hb 4135 , such as republican <MASK> sen . dennis linthicum , agreed in general with the direction of the bill but expressed concern that the legislation ’ s wording gave “ the committee too much power and provides the legislature too little oversight .” <PARA> according to the <MASK> - general , “ lawmakers on both sides agreed the current form [ was ] in dire need of improvement ,” primarily owing to its overly complicated or vague wording . in a broad sense the bill made two substantive changes to existing advance directive laws , which were first passed in 1993 and had not been modified until 2018 , as described by the corvallis gazette - times : <PARA> in oregon , this area of legislation frequently intersects with concerns raised by pro - life groups that typically focus on the rights of the unborn . that ’ s because advance directives can include directions and preferences on receiving ( or declining ) life - sustaining treatments under certain circumstances . in their <MASK> , life news attempted to draw a connection between this proposed legislation and oregon ’ s 1997 death with dignity act , implying the new law represented a step toward forced euthanasia via the cessation of life support or artificial feeding of persons medically incapable of making medical decisions for themselves : <PARA> this is a bad - faith argument . while certain circumstances exist in which it would be legal in oregon to cease providing tube - feeding or other life support to mentally incapacitated individuals who left no advance directive and whose next of kin or legal representatives could not be located , such a scenario existed in oregon <MASK> law before house bill 4135 . and the plausibility of that scenario remained largely unchanged following <MORE> 635 <MASK> that “ life - sustaining procedures that would otherwise be applied to a principal who is incapable and who does not have an appointed health care representative or applicable valid advance directive may be withheld or withdrawn ... if the principal has been medically confirmed to be in one of the following conditions : <PARA> the notion that the bill would “ allow for the starving of patients with dementia or mental illness ” comes from the subsequent portions of ors 127 . 635 , which touch on scenarios under which an “ incapable ” adult meets the above conditions and has no appointed healthcare representative , next of kin , or advance directive under oregon law : <PARA> this section <MASK> that if a mentally incapable person meets the criteria described in all the excerpts above , but that person does not have an advance directive or appointed health care representative , the de facto representative shall be drawn from a specific list of people ranging from an authorized guardian to “ any adult relative or adult friend .” if none of these people can be identified , the law <MASK> “ then life - sustaining procedures may be withheld or withdrawn upon the direction and under the supervision of the attending physician .” <PARA> as mentioned before , though , the entirety of the oregon law cited above , which could allow for the termination of life support for incapable individuals who met extremely narrow criteria , existed prior to senate bill 494 or house bill 4135 . the legislation signed into law in 2018 did make minor changes to section 127 . 635 of the oregon revised <MASK> , but the substance of these laws remains unchanged . before the passage of house bill 4135 , as well as after , the only situation in which the headline <MASK> that it is legal to “ starve mentally ill patients to death ” would be <MASK> would be a situation in which : <PARA> a person who suffers from mental illness or dementia may be classified as “ incapable ,” but that is not sufficient grounds for terminating life support . this was <MASK> before house bill 4135 , and it remains <MASK> now after that bill was signed into law : that law made no changes to ors 127 . 580 . the most notable change made to 127 . 635 was the addition of a clause after the sentence “ life -

misinfo,"i know this subject is rather embarrassing , but i was glad my sister passed this message to me , and i hope you will send it along to other women , too . <PARA> a woman i work with started using the new tampax pearl 5 months ago and that ’ s when she started getting yeast infections . they got worse and worse every month and being experienced with yeast infections , she used over - the - counter treatments . they didn ’ t help . she finally went to her doctor , who did a pap smear , which didn ’ t reveal anything . as it got worse , she finally went to her ob - gyn , who also did a pap smear . it didn ’ t test positive , but bacteria showed up . she was then given a prescription to treat a yeast infection and went home . she went back as it got worse and also when , one day while using the bathroom , a clump of something came out . she had no idea what it was initially and threw it away . she quickly thought better of it and wrapped it up and brought it with her in a ziploc baggie to yet another visit to the doctor . she had figured out what it was herself and the doctor confirmed it . it was the tampax pearl fibers . they had been collecting for the past 5 months ! ! she even took an unopened tampon and showed me how the fibers come off so easily . you wouldn ’ t notice because the applicator covers it . and how many people open up a tampon and inspect them ? <PARA> well , it hasn ’ t ended yet . when she went in last , the doctor went to get some cultures , but found that her cervix was bleeding and it prevented her from getting all the cultures that she needed . the fibers from the tampon are cutting her and making her bleed . but the blood is having a hard time getting out and so there was a lot of old blood in the way when the doctor tried to take the cultures . right now , she is not being treated for anything , not until they can figure out how to treat her . poor woman is uncomfortable and in pain ! most likely , they ’ ll have to do a d & c ( did i use the right letters ?) to clean it all out . another girl that i work with also has been using them for a few months and has been having problems , but couldn ’ t figure it out . she won ’ t be using them anymore . <PARA> i have used a few , just to try them , but will be throwing out any that i have left . <MORE> <PARA> the warning message <MASK> at the head of this page , which purportedly describes the experience of a pearl user who suffered continual yeast infections and then found that fibers from pearl tampons had been accumulating inside her for five months and caused her cervix to bleed , is similarly unlikely . yeast infections are normally caused by a fungus , a particular problem when the normal biological balance of the vagina is disturbed ( e . g ., through changes in hormone levels during pregnancy , use of birth control pills , and the normal fluctuation in ph level of the vagina during menstruation ). nothing about the tampax pearl tampon suggests that it would be the cause of a increased incidence of yeast infections , as it ’ s made from the same materials as just about every other tampon . the same reasoning applies to <MASK> of fiber residue and vaginal bleeding or vaginal ulcers : these are problems which are occasionally experienced by users of all brands of tampons and long antedate the development of the tampax pearl .

info,"in his urban legend book the baby train , folklorist jan harold brunvand writes that he first heard the “ dead body found under hotel bed ” legend in 1991 . every version that came to him mentioned a las vegas hotel , but the lack of checkable details led him to believe this was an apocryphal tale . <PARA> okay , so we can date the appearance of this legend to 1991 . unlike a number of other such gruesome tales , this legend appears to have sprung from a misremembering of any one of a number of actual news items , with the talebearer shifting certain details so that deaths which took place in anonymous little motels along <MASK> are said to have happened in las vegas , america ’ s own sin city , and victims who ’ d ( usually ) done little else amiss than be in the wrong place at the wrong time and / or take up with questionable company were transformed through the magic of retelling into prostitutes . <PARA> dead bodies get stashed in the box spring or the bed ’ s pedestal more often than you ’ d want to believe . what ’ s more , a fair number of them are only discovered days later ... after the new tenant complains about a persistent and disagreeable odor . <PARA> in each of the following cases not only were bodies discovered under hotel beds , but it was investigations of the smell of decomposition that led to their discoveries . <PARA> on 10 july 2003 , a man checked into the capri motel , just east of downtown kansas city , and began complaining about a foul odor in his room . management told him nothing could be done about the problem , and he spent three nights in his room before checking out because he could no longer stand the smell . when the cleaning staff came in to make up the room on 13 july , they lifted the mattress and underneath found a man ’ s body in an advanced stage of decomposition . <PARA> on 10 june 1999 the rapidly decomposing remains of 64 - year - old saul hernandez were discovered inside the bed in room 112 at the burgundy motor inn in atlantic city , new jersey . a german couple had spent the night sleeping over hernandez ’ s remains , and it was their complaint to the manager about the smell in their room which led to the discovery of the corpse . <PARA> in july 1996 a woman ’ s body was found under a mattress in the colorado boulevard travelodge in pasadena , ca . apparently the motel ’ s staff discovered her ten days after her demise and only after guests had complained for several days of a foul odor coming from that room . <PARA> there were two stashed - and - smelly body cases in florida <MORE> where millbrook had been living just prior to her disappearance , her body having just been discovered inside the frame of the bed there — even though the room had reportedly been cleaned and rented several times since her disappearance almost seven weeks earlier . <PARA> there are , of course , numerous other cases of dead bodies being left under hotel beds , but i ’ ve chosen not to report on these because they lack the key element of the legend : complaints about the presence of a horrific smell leading to the corpse ’ s discovery . what gives this urban legend its chills -

misinfo,"it ’ s difficult for those who weren ’ t around to experience the 1960s first - hand to fully understand the controversy that swirled around radical parties such as the black panthers . certainly many americans viewed them as representing the very worst of that era ’ s political movements : a group of hate - filled militant thugs who felt their disaffection with the existing social and political systems justified anything required to achieve their aim of “ revolution by any means necessary ” ( such as smuggling guns into a marin county courtroom in an attempt to free panther george jackson , resulting in a shoot - out that killed a judge , two inmates , and jackson ’ s brother ). others at the time , however , believed the panthers were the only political group that truly represented a downtrodden and marginalized group of people who had been enslaved , discriminated against , and denied civil rights protections for hundreds of years ; that sought to improve the condition of the poor by operating schools , opening medical clinics , and providing free breakfasts for ghetto children ; and that had the courage to stand up to the brutality visited upon them by law enforcement acting in the service of a government and a society that sought to “ keep them in their place .” <PARA> in may of 1969 , black panther founder and national chairman bobby seale ( who had already been indicted for his alleged participation in demonstrations at the democratic national convention in chicago in august 1968 ) made a trip from oakland to new haven , connecticut , to speak at yale university . the black panthers were by then nationally known , a focus of media attention , and under the active surveillance of the fbi .

misinfo,"when we think of dangers lurking in our food , we tend to concentrate on the threats posed by chemical additives or by improper and careless handling . yet the truth is we routinely come into contact with naturally occurring poisons in a number of the fruits we ingest . <PARA> apples are one such fruit : their pips ( seeds ) contain amygdalin , a cyanide and sugar compound that degrades into hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) when metabolized . cyanide itself is a poison that kills by denying blood the ability to carry oxygen and thereby causes its victims to die of asphyxiation . at least within the realm of murder mysteries , cyanide is the darling of poisoners because it acts quickly and irrevocably : once a fatal dose has been ingested , there is no effective antidote , and death takes place within minutes . it is sometimes described as having a bitter almond smell , but it does not always give off an odor , nor can everyone detect the scent . cyanide is usually found joined with other chemicals in compounds : hydrogen cyanide , cyanogen chloride , sodium cyanide , and potassium cyanide . in the death camps of world war ii , the nazis used hydrogen cyanide ( zyklon b ) for their gas chambers . <PARA> luckily for those fond of their granny smiths , the body can detoxify cyanide in small doses , and the number of apple seeds it takes to pack a lethal punch is therefore so huge that even the most dedicated of apple eaters is extremely unlikely to ingest enough pips to cause any harm . yet those who have heard apple seeds house a poison ( usually remembered as arsenic , a quite different though equally deadly compound ) cling to the frightening belief swallowing a small number of pips spells instant death . we ’ ve had folks fret to us that ingesting as few as three apple seeds would do someone in , a “ fact ” which , if <MASK> , would mean each and every one of us was flirting with the grim reaper every time we made a grab for a delicious . <PARA> apple pips also have a tough protective coating which makes swallowing them even less of a risky proposition ; unless the pips are pulverized or masticated , the amygdalin they house remains safely contained within . apple pips have hard , durable shells that allow them to pass intact through the digestive systems of animals , a quality which helps the apple to reproduce by distributing its seeds to new locations far from the <MASK> trees . were apple pips susceptible to the eroding effects of digestive juices , apple trees could not reproduce nearly as well as they do , as their seeds would not be so widely spread and a good many of the pips would be destroyed before germinating . <PARA> cherry , peach , and apricot pits also contain amygdalin ; the latter two , at least , in potentially harmful amounts . fortunately , peach and apricot pits are sufficiently large and hard that few people intentionally swallow or chew them . ( the unapproved anti - cancer drug laetrile is a semisynthetic derivative of amygdalin ; a cheaper version of laetrile produced in mexico came from crushed apricot pits .) <PARA> a far greater natural source of cyanide is the cassava root , a vegetable favored by many in africa .

misinfo,"social media is often where activists , politicians , non - profit groups , or simply members of the public share their concerns and outrage over what they perceive as miscarriages of justice . excessive punishments , racial disparities in sentencing , and an apparently permissive attitude towards sexual assault among some judges and prosecutors have all formed the basis of viral facebook and twitter memes in recent years . <PARA> towards the end of 2018 and in the beginning of 2019 , one case in particular caught the attention of social media users : jacob walter anderson , a former student and fraternity president at baylor university in texas , was accused of raping a sophomore outside a frat party but ended up receiving what many observers viewed as an outrageously insufficient punishment . <PARA> note : the following <MASK> includes details and descriptions of an alleged sexual assault , which might be upsetting to some readers . <PARA> on 13 december 2018 , facebook user lesley templeton keith posted what became a widely shared set of <MASK> about anderson ’ s case , accompanied by what was presented as a photograph of him : <PARA> similarly , <USER> tweeted on 11 december : <PARA> “ jacob walter anderson former president of phi delta theta drugged , gagged , & repeatedly raped his victim til she lost consciousness . he got a $ 400 fine & will not have to register as a sex offender . twitter please spread his name & face & fucking ruin him !” <PARA> and on 12 december , <USER> tweeted what appeared to be photographs of anderson and 19th district court judge ralph strother , along with the following message : <PARA> “ on the left , jacob walter anderson , who raped a virgin and left her unconscious . on the right , judge ralph strother , who thought a $ 400 fine was appropriate . remember their names and faces , this must follow them wherever they are for the rest of their lives .” <PARA> some of these <MASK> were accurate , while others lacked context or left out relevant information . however , the central and most substantial <MASK> , that anderson brutally raped the woman and left her unconscious , remains unproven because the case never went to trial and therefore crucial <MASK> is not publicly available , no examination of witnesses took place , and no jury issued a verdict . <PARA> waco police arrested anderson on 3 march 2016 over an incident that had taken place at a party almost two weeks earlier , as the waco tribune -

misinfo,"this came about because they implemented a policy requiring students and parents to be responsible for their children ’ s absences and missing homework . the school and teachers are being sued by parents who want their children ’ s failing grades changed to passing grades even though those children were absent 15 - 30 times during the semester and did not complete enough school work to pass their classes . this was voted unanimously by the office staff as the actual answering machine message for the school : <PARA> “ hello ! you have reached the automated answering service of your school . in order to assist you in connecting the right staff member , please listen to all your options before making a selection : <PARA> <MASK> : the palisades charter schools are a consortium of public schools in pacific palisades , california , that have received charters from the los angeles unified school district ( lausd ) allowing them to operate autonomously . according to the palisades charter schools foundation : <PARA> the purpose of these schools is to improve student learning ; encourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods ; create new professional opportunities for teachers , including the opportunity to be responsible for the learning program at the schools site ; provide parents and students with expanded educational opportunities within the public school system without the constraints of traditional bureaucratic rules and structure ; and provide schools a way to shift from a rule - based to a performance based system of accountability . in essence , charter schools allow for increased flexibility in exchange for increased accountability . <PARA> in 1998 the sole high school in the palisades charter schools group , the 2 , 400 - student palisades charter high school , instituted an attendance policy mandating that any student absent without a valid excuse ten or more days per <PARA> semester be failed , regardless of his academic achievements . one of the results of this policy was that in february 2002 forty palisades high teachers assigned a total of 130 failing grades to students whose classwork would otherwise have merited passing grades , because those students recorded absences and tardiness in excess of the school ’ s <MASK> attendance policy . <PARA> after vociferous complaints ( and threats of lawsuits ) from parents who contended they were unaware of , or didn ’ t agree with , palisades high ’ s attendance policy ( even though every student and parent had been informed of it ), lausd officials said the failing marks might have to be voided because the attendance policy was not submitted to and approved by the school board . without board approval , the school must follow the policies of the lausd , which <MASK> that students must be graded on the work they do and attendance may not be used as a reason to fail <PARA> them . <PARA> palisades high officials maintained that lausd district administrators had a copy of palisades ’ attendance policy in their possession when they approved palisades charter high , and that in any case , palisades ’ charter school <MASK> allowed school officials to set their own rules without inteference from the district . as education week noted , the lausd ’ s “ decision rankled the teachers , who argue [ d ] that their charter school <PARA> is exempt from such governance , but it also has sparked a heated conversation about standards , accountability , teachers ’ rights , and the influence of politically powerful parents .” <PARA> the putative answering machine message for palisades charter high <MASK> above was concocted in part as a reaction to the brouhaha over the school ’ s attendance policy , and in part as a sardonic expression of all the usual frustrations teachers experience in dealing with students and parents : fabricated excuses for students ’ absences and uncompleted homework , blame that teachers are solely responsible for the failures of non - achieving students , complaints from parents about not having received information already sent to them several times , etc . however , the staff “ voted ” for the message only in the sense that they agreed with its sentiments ( the circulating version of this piece often omits the introductory line “ too bad they can ’ t actually use it ...“); it was not ever actually placed on the phone answering system at palisades charter high . ( in fact , the palisades charter high phone system didn ’ t have menu options when we checked in december 2002 : a switchboard operator fielded calls when the office was open , and a recording invited callers to leave voicemail or press keys to access a specific extension directly when the office was closed .) <PARA> variations : a march 2009 version ( circulated with an mp3 recording ) identified the institution with the unusual phone message as maroochydore high school , in queensland , australia , and added a further “ menu option ” of ‘ if you want this in another language , move to a country that speaks it .’",-0001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00

info,"just three years shy of the 400th anniversary of the legendarily peaceful meal shared by members of the mashtree wampanoag tribe with newly - arrived pilgrims in an event that has since been commemorated as thanksgiving , descendants of those same native americans protested in the u . s . capital against a variation on a sad historical theme . <PARA> after being promised that 321 acres of their ancestral land would be preserved in trust , the tribe saw their hopes dashed when the trump administration reversed course from its predecessor . <PARA> the mashpee wampanoag tribe is currently suing the federal government because the department of the interior ( doi ) on 7 september 2018 reversed an obama - era decision to put 321 acres of land in trust on behalf of the tribe . although the final outcome rests on a court ’ s interpretation of whether the tribe was under “ federal jurisdiction ” according to a 1934 law , the land is viewed by the indigenous community as their means to future self - determination . <PARA> thus , as many americans planned for a thanksgiving feast , tribe members and their supporters marched on the u . s . capitol protesting the decision , which they say could cost them lands the tribe has lived on for 12 , 000 years . <PARA> in an op - ed for the boston globe explaining the community ’ s plight , tribal council vice chairwoman jessie little doe baird wrote : <PARA> according to court documents , the situation stemmed from a years - long battle in which the tribe “ sought to address its landlessness ” and petitioned the doi “ to acquire in trust approximately 170 acres of land in mashpee , massachusetts , and approximately 150 acres near taunton , massachusetts .” <PARA> the tribal community planned to use the land for “ self - determination and self - governance ” as well as housing , education , and cultural preservation . they also wanted to ensure the preservation of an ancestral burial ground and develop land in taunton for an indian gaming facility “ with revenues intended to support the mashpee tribal government and meet the needs of tribal members ,” court documents <MASK> . <PARA> mashpee wampanoag members received happy news on 18 september 2015 when they were informed the federal government would acquire 151 acres in taunton and 170 in mashpee and hold the land in trust for the tribe . but some east taunton residents filed suit over the issue in 2016 , and a federal court sided with the residents against the tribe , holding that the interior department did not have the authority to take land in trust for the tribe in the manner they did . <PARA> both parties appealed that decision , but in 2017 the u . s . justice department dropped their participation in the appeal , leaving the mashpee wampanoag to contest the issue on their own . then on 7 september 2018 , the doi issued a decision that reversed their previous one , finding that the mashpee wampanoag were not eligible to have land held in federal trust for them because they didn ’ t meet the criterion of having been considered “ under federal jurisdiction ” in 1934 , the year the indian reorganization act ( ira ) was passed , a <MASK> paramount to a tribe ’ s receiving land in trust . <PARA> the tribe then asked the court for a stay of their <MASK> appeal of the taunton plaintiffs ’ lawsuit while they pursued a separate lawsuit against the doi to compel that agency to set aside their decision declaring the tribe ineligible to be granted land in trust . <PARA> “ in its decision , the department failed to apply established law , contorting some of the relevant facts and ignoring others to engineer a negative decision ,” the tribe ’ s lawsuit <MASK> . “ as a result the department ’ s decision is arbitrary , capricious and contrary to law , and if left unaddressed , will have a <MASK> impact on the tribe .” <PARA> interior department officials ultimately determined that the tribe was not under federal jurisdiction in 1934 , while the mashpee wampanoag contend they submitted “ mounds of <MASK> ” documenting that they were indeed under federal jurisdiction before 1934 . on 20 november 2018 , the doi asked the court for a 31 - day extension on a deadline to respond to the tribe ’ s lawsuit <PARA> even if the mashpee wampanoag were to prevail in their lawsuit against the doi , they would still have to succeed in their appeal of the taunton lawsuit holding that the land was improperly acquired by the interior department in the first place . on 9 october 2018 , the plantiffs ’ attorney filed a request arguing that the tribe should not be granted another stay in the appeal process . <PARA> in her op - ed , baird noted that although her ancestors shared a peaceful meal with pilgrims , the <MASK> often told about the <MASK> thanksgiving leaves out a less heartwarming aspect of american <MASK> :",2018-11-28T21:48:36+00:00
misinfo,"the boy scouts of america , a bastion of civil society and traditional values for more than a century in the united <MASK> , has undertaken some significant changes in recent years . <PARA> following a long - standing controversy , the organization in 2014 lifted their ban on openly gay members , in 2015 allowed openly gay adult scout leaders for the first time , and in 2017 allowed transgender boys to join for the first time . <PARA> in october 2017 , the group announced that they would be allowing girls to join the cub scouts , and that they would be launching a new program for older girls in 2019 which would eventually allow them to attain the rank of eagle scout . although the boy scouts of america ( bsa ) already had programs that welcomed older boys and girls , the path to eagle scout was not yet open to young women . <PARA> in may 2018 , the organization announced that they would be changing the name of the “ boy scouts ” program to the gender - neutral “ scouts bsa ” in february 2019 . and a few days later , the bsa and the church of jesus christ of latter - day saints ( the mormon church ) jointly announced that the church would be ending their longstanding partnership with the organization in january 2020 . <PARA> these events prompted one right - wing web site to link the bsa ’ s recent moves towards gender and lgbt inclusivity with the mormon church ’ s decision to cut ties wuth scouting . on 9 may 2018 , the conservative tribune ( also known as western journal ) published a video which reported that : <PARA> technically , the bsa did not announce they were changing the name of their organization , but rather the name of the well - known “ boy scouts ” program ( for 11 - 17 year - olds ) to the gender - neutral “ scouts bsa .” in a press release , chief scout executive michael surbaugh said that “ starting in february 2019 , the name of the older youth program will be ‘ scouts bsa ,’ and the name of our iconic organization will continue to be boy scouts of america .” <PARA> according to the associated press , the mormon church contributes around 425 , 000 out of 2 . 3 million bsa members . if all of these members ultimately ended their participation in scouting , that would represent a loss of 18 . 5 percent of the bsa ’ s total membership , a very significant portion . <PARA> however , the church will continue their partnership with the bsa until 1 january 2020 . contrary to the conservative tribune ’ s headline , then , the scouts did not “ lose 425 , 000 boys one week after announcing name change ,” though it appears they may lose that <MORE> members with obvious unease and caution . <PARA> the mormon church officially accepts openly gay and lesbian individuals as members and leaders , but only if they remain celibate , as the church ’ s web site notes : “ sexual relations between a man and woman who are not married , or between people of the same sex , violate one of our father in heaven ’ s most important laws and get in the way of our eternal progress .” <PARA> when the bsa moved to accept gay and transgender members in recent years , the church obtained assurances from the scouts that the church could “ operate its programs in ways that are consistent with our standards and beliefs .” <PARA> in january 2018 , the church ended their participation in two bsa programs for 14 - 20 year - olds , varsity and venturing , explaining that those programs had “ historically been difficult to implement within the church .” ( venturing is a co - ed bsa program where older teenage boys and girls pursue more adventurous , outdoors activities together .) <PARA> however , in announcing the decision to end their participation in varsity and venturing , the church stipulated that it was unrelated to recent speculation about increased integration of girls and young women in the bsa : “ our decision to end our participation in the varsity and venturing programs was made independent of this possibility and before that time .” <PARA> furthermore , while the church ’ s announcement of an end to their partnership with the bsa did come just days after the bsa announced they would be changing the name of the “ boy scouts ” program , a lengthy transition period will still occur between the two events . <PARA> the inclusion of girls in “ scouts bsa ” ( formerly the “ boy scouts ” program ) will begin in february 2019 . the mormon church and its members will continue to take part in bsa activities until january 2020 , a period of 11 months . <PARA> so if the church , in deciding to cut ties with the bsa , was objecting to the increased integration of girls , it does not appear to have been sufficiently bothered by it to prevent those 11 months of overlap . <PARA> ultimately , it ’ s not clear whether or to what extent the bsa ’ s moves towards increased inclusivity played a role in the mormon church ’ s decision to cut ties . unfortunately , the church has not clearly answered this question . <PARA> given the mormon church ’ s teachings on lgbt issues and the separate roles of men and woman , as well as their previous uneasy responses to boy scout announcements on inclusion , it has to be considered plausible that the bsa ’ s announcements might have played a role in the church ’ s decision to cut ties .",2018-05-10T22:35:31+00:00

misinfo,"a meme posted in the facebook group “ lyme disease posters ” on 3 december 2016 ( and its accompanying text ) provides dire warnings about the risks posed by potentially tick - infested christmas trees . <PARA> while ticks , specifically the kind that can transmit lyme disease , are indeed a serious medical concern and could conceivably be found on christmas trees brought into your home , the information presented in this meme is generally misleading , scientifically inaccurate , or incomplete . more likely than not , a christmas tree would not contain any lyme disease - bearing ticks , and if it did the overwhelming likelihood is that the tick would not be in a position to transmit a disease during christmas . <PARA> lyme disease is caused by the borrelia genus of bacteria which is transferred from one animal ( typically birds or small rodents ), into the gut of a specific genus of tick called blacklegged ticks ( genus ixodes ) in their larval stages , where it can then be transferred to a human through biting once that tick is in later stages of life . <PARA> per the centers for disease control and prevention : <PARA> a blacklegged tick ’ s feeding times are seasonally determined , with little to no activity happening during the weeks leading up to christmas , according to the minnesota department of health ( though the information is broadly applicable to all blacklegged ticks ): <PARA> this is the season - to - season life cycle of a blacklegged tick , according to the cdc , which shows the times of highest risk of transfer to humans is late spring into summer : <PARA> the blacklegged tick ’ s ability to transmit the disease to a human is dominantly relegated to only one - and - a - half of its four life stages ( the nymph stage and female adult stage ). both of these stages are generally dormant during christmas , making most of the <MASK> about the dangers of ticks and lyme disease in christmas trees fairly trivial . the actual human data provided by the cdc bore this out as well , clearly demonstrating that there are relatively few cases of lyme disease during christmas based on 10 years of monthly data : <PARA> that being said , here ’ s some background on specific assertions made by the meme : <PARA> ticks typically attach themselves to grass and smaller shrubs , not trees . further , as mentioned above , the “ all ages ” shouldn ’ t really be frightening , as we are interested only in nymphs and female adults who have previously fed on another disease carrying bird or mammal . these critters are not typically interested in feeding during christmas . <PARA> fully engorged ( that is to say , freshly fed ) female deer ticks do indeed lay numerous eggs — up to 3000 , in fact . there are three important things to note , though , when talking about tick eggs in christmas trees . the first is that deer ticks lay eggs in may — a time that is demonstrably not christmas . the second is that they lay their eggs in the ground ( a place demonstrably not a christmas tree ). third , larvae ( in terms of transferring a disease to a humans ) are all born pathogen - free . if the larvae for some reason were not born dormant ( unlikely ) and then used a human as a host ( impossible ), it would have no pathogen to transfer . <PARA> only blacklegged ticks are capable of transmitting lyme disease , and within those species they are further limited to transmitting diseases to humans only in their nymph and female adult life stages . larval blacklegged ticks and the eggs from which they come are scientifically incapable of transferring disease to humans . <PARA> other ticks do carry other diseases . for an overview of those risks and their location , the cdc has a convenient map of the six potentially infectious tick species in the united <MASK> . if you are concerned that you may have been bitten by a tick or have symptoms of lyme disease , the cdc also has a helpful guide here . <PARA> the bottom line is — at least from a lyme disease perspective — christmas is pretty much the safest time of the year to bring a tree into your house .",2016-12-06T04:23:35+00:00

misinfo,"gun violence and gun control have been the subject of renewed debate since the february 2018 shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland , florida . <PARA> in particular , those in favor of enhanced regulation of gun ownership have focused on the ar - 15 semi - automatic rifle , which has been used in a number of high - profile mass shootings in recent years , including the massacre in parkland . in june 2018 , a dispute arose online over the physical impact and damage that can be caused by a bullet fired from an ar - 15 . <PARA> ] facebook user m . a . rothman posted two photographs side by side : one featured a poster which <MASK> to show “ the size of a hole used by an ar - 15 ,” and the other showed what rothman said was the <MASK> ( smaller ) dimensions of marks left by an ar - 15 rifle after target practice : <PARA> it ’ s not clear what are the precise <MASK> of the photograph on the left , or where it was taken . the poster has become the subject of ridicule and anger among some gun rights advocates online , prompting parodies and responses such as this one , which was shared more than 50 , 000 times on facebook . <PARA> in brief , both sides in this dispute are right in some ways and wrong in others , and each photograph offers an incomplete examination of the kind of damage and impact that can be caused by gun shots . <PARA> at the heart of the issue is the question of what is meant by the “ hole made by an ar - 15 .” there are basically three possibilities : the entrance wound , the exit wound , and the cavity caused by a bullet as travels through a person ’ s body . there are no graphic images in this <MASK> , but we do at times get into descriptions of the damage caused by gun shots that some readers might find upsetting . <PARA> the entrance wound <PARA> the “ black hole ” shown in the poster is vastly too large to represent an ar - 15 entrance wound . jay wachtel , a retired police sergeant and special agent in the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms , and a former criminal justice lecturer at california <MASK> university , summed it up in an e - mail : “ the entrance wound for any firearm projectile is essentially the bullet diameter .” <PARA> typically , ar - 15 rifles are loaded with . 223 remington cartridges , which are housed in bullets with a diameter of 5 . 7 millimetres . so a round fired correctly from a functioning ar - 15 should create an entrance wound ( or target practice marking ) just under a quarter - inch in diameter . <PARA> <MORE> an ar - 15 exit wound — but it is possible . while entrance wounds typically have the same dimensions as the bullet that causes them , the size and shape of exit wounds can vary more . <PARA> dr . sydney vail is a trauma surgeon with the maricopa integrated health system in phoenix , arizona , and is an expert in treating gunshot trauma . he explained to us some of the factors that determine the dimensions of exit wounds : <PARA> dr . judy melinek , a forensic pathologist from san francisco , california , explained to us the circumstances in which an ar - 15 might leave behind an unusually large exit wound . by email , she told us : <PARA> in her assessment , an exit wound the size of the “ black hole ” shown in the poster could potentially be caused by an ar - 15 round , but it is not likely , and certainly not typical . melinek told us that in her experience , ar - 15 rounds can completely fragment in the body and may not exit at all . <PARA> michael knox is a florida - based forensic consultant who conducts ballistics testing and crime scene reconstructions , and is regularly called upon to give expert testimony in criminal trials . his assessment of the “ black hole ” on the poster was blunt . by e - mail , he told us : “ the exit hole from an ar - 15 round would not be that big .” <PARA> conclusion <PARA> the photographs shown in the viral facebook post are a useful conversation - starter , but comparing them doesn ’ t serve readers well as an explanation of the physical impact of gun shots in general , or high - velocity ar - 15 rounds in particular . <PARA> based on the assessments shared with us by the experts we consulted — a forensic pathologist , a trauma surgeon , a former federal agent and criminal justice lecturer , and a forensic consultant and ballistics expert — we can say that the entrance wound from an ar - 15 round could not be anywhere near that large ; however , the tract of catastrophic damage torn through a person ’ s internal blood vessels , tissue , and bone by a high - velocity ar - 15 round could plausibly have around the same diameter as the “ black hole ” in the poster . <PARA> finally , it is unlikely that an ar - 15 exit wound would have the same dimensions as the “ black hole ” shown in the poster , but it is possible . the bullet would have to travel through the body in such a way that it fragmented bone and tissue to the extent that all that matter was forced out of the body along with the bullet itself , creating an exceptionally large exit wound .",2018-06-15T17:11:19+00:00

misinfo,"<MASK> : in the long career of actor , screenwriter , and film director sylvester stallone , he is best known for portraying two iconic movie characters in multiple films : the boxer rocky balboa and the soldier of fortune john rambo . despite all that has been written and discussed regarding stallone ’ s personal life during the years since those roles propelled him to hollywood stardom , we ’ ve found little mention by stallone himself of the role religion has played in his life . <PARA> in late 2006 , while promoting the release of his film rocky balboa , sylvester stallone undertook some interviews with religious news media ( such as one with pat robertson for the christian broadcasting network ) in which he discussed his faith , and in an <PARA> <MASK> published by the catholic news service , stallone <MASK> that he “ grew up catholic , stopped going to church after he tasted fame and fortune , but now considers himself a churchgoing catholic again ,” the latter aspect spurred by medical issues his daughter sophia had experienced several years earlier : <PARA> stallone tried to find the words to describe what brought about his self - imposed exile from catholicism . “ i don ’ t know . life ,” he said . “ your career is going , you ’ re not communicating with your family .” the weight of celebrity was “ very heavy ,” he added . “ i didn ’ t have any strong foundation behind me of people that would keep my feet on the ground . i was extremely seduced by the newfound freedom .” <PARA> things started turning around for stallone , he said , before his marriage in 1997 to his third and current wife , jennifer flavin . “ when i got married everything changed ,” he said . “ when my daughter was born sick , and i realized i really needed some help here , i started putting everything in god ’ s hands , his omnipotence , his all - forgivingness .” stallone added that being catholic “ puts me where i should be . i was alone in the world . i thought i would have to handle things in my own way .” but then “ i thought if i put myself in jesus ’ hands and asked for insight and guidance i am basically taking the yoke off of me and using his intelligence and wisdom to make the proper decision ,” he said . <PARA> however , although in that round of interviews sylvester stallone made reference to “ putting himself in jesus ’ hands ” in seeking insight and guidance for dealing with his daughter ’ s illness , he didn ’ t publicly announce that he had “ surrendered his life to the lord jesus christ .” moreover , those interviews took place over nine years ago , and stallone has since contradicted some of the expressions of religiosity he made back in 2006 in more recent interviews . <PARA> for example , during a september 2010 interview with gq magazine , stallone said that although he was baptized catholic and considered himself “ spiritual ,” he did not “ belong to a structured church ”: <PARA> a : i ’ m pretty spiritual ; i believe a lot in the spirit of man . i ’ m certainly not an atheist . i was baptized catholic , but i don ’ t belong to a structured church . i have no opposition to it . i think there ’ s great nuggets of knowledge in there , some wonderful rules to live by . then the flip side is the amount of agony that ’ s caused , which is , excuse me ? <PARA> q : do you ever have any concerns about your own mortality ? <PARA> a : i don ’ t believe that we go anyplace . you make your heaven and hell right here , and you are what you leave behind . but don ’ t think that you ’ re going to change anything ; you ’ re not . <PARA> so even if sylvester stallone may have described himself as a “ churchgoing catholic ” once again in 2006 , by the end of 2010 he had <MASK> that he didn ’ t belong to any “ structured church ” at all . <PARA> thus it was somewhat surprising when the item reproduced above began circulating via social media in august 2013 , <MASK> that sylvester stallone “ has surrendered his life to the lord jesus christ , and announced it to the public several days ago ” — it made no sense other than as a recirculated or out - of - date reference to comments stallone had made about his return to catholicism back in the 1990s and not as a report of any current event .

( as george seaton , he would go on to a career in hollywood as a screenwriter - director - producer , winning two academy awards for his screenplays along the way .) stenius was replaced by actor jack deeds , who lasted only a few days before being dismissed as ill - suited for the job . james jewell , the <MASK> ’ s dramatic director , filled in for one performance before hiring earle graser , who took over as the lone ranger on 18 april 1933 . <PARA> earle graser was the lone ranger on radio for the next eight years , a dedicated professional whose voice became indelibly associated with the image of the character he portrayed : <PARA> a truly mild - mannered man in real life , [ graser ] was radio ’ s real - life clark kent . the microphone was his phone booth . there he shone . there he made everyone believe . you heard that great deep voice and you knew that there really was a mysterious masked rider out there somewhere . there really was a lone ranger . <PARA> earle graser ’ s tenure as the actor behind the image of the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains came to an abrupt end when tragedy struck on the morning of 8 april 1941 : graser fell asleep at the wheel of his car and was killed when it slammed into a parked trailer . ( contrary to some versions of this <MASK> , there was no suggestion in the press that graser had died in a “ disgraceful way ” by driving while intoxicated , thereby necessitating a cover - up of his death .) <PARA> graser ’ s death presented several immediate problems to the lone ranger ’ s producers . the first was that a new actor for the lead role had to be found very quickly , as the show aired live three days a week , with no reruns or pre - recorded broadcasts to fall back upon . another issue was that the serial needed to avoid an abrupt transition in slotting another actor into the title role : it wouldn ’ t do to have listeners who had grown familiar with one particular voice for the lone ranger over the course of several years notice that he suddenly sounded very different from one day to the next . <MORE> suggested the part be filled by brace beemer , an announcer and studio manager who had at times narrated the lone ranger program , had been making personal appearances as the lone ranger since the show ’ s early days ( because he was much more visually suited to the role than graser ), and was currently playing the lead in challenge of the yukon ( which only aired once a week and therefore presented less of a problem with role identification ). <PARA> brace beemer ’ s voice was noticeably deeper than earl graser ’ s , however , so the lone ranger ‘ s producers had to come up with some way of gradually easing him into the role in order to avoid an abrupt transition that might stigmatize beemer as a mere replacement . the stratagem finally decided upon was a five - part transition series in which a bed - ridden lone ranger struggled to recover from gunshot wounds that rendered him unable to speak . for five episodes in 1941 ( april 9 through april 18 ), the lone ranger whispered , breathed , grunted , and communicated with tonto through notes scrawled in pencil as he recuperated with the aid of an army surgeon . meanwhile , tonto faithfully followed his instructions to “ ride for us both ” and continually assured the audience that the lone ranger would be back in the saddle again one day : <PARA> the transition series served its dual purpose of convincing children that , despite what they may have heard on the news , the lone ranger was not dead , and of providing a bridge to beemer ’ s assumption of a full - voiced lone ranger role . when the lone ranger recovered from his injuries and resumed undertaking his usual adventures ( as well as talking again ), maybe some listeners noticed his voice was significantly deeper and richer than before . but it had been a few weeks since they had last heard him speak , and with no reruns available through which the audience might compare his current vocal sound with his previous one , it was natural enough for the difference to be chalked up to inconstant memory and / or the implication that the change was an outgrowth of the lone ranger ’ s gradual return to health and strength . <PARA> any concerns about a drop - off in the popularity of the lone ranger were quickly laid to rest , and within six months the serial began the longest — and to many listeners , the best — adventure of the lone ranger ’ s career , a five - month <MASK> arc in which the masked man took on the nefarious legion of the black arrow . brace beemer was the voice of the lone ranger for the next thirteen years , until the radio series ended with its last live broadcast on 3 september 1954 .",1999-08-16T10:43:34+00:00

misinfo,"in april 2006 , the experience of a 14 - year - old who had eaten pancakes made from a mix that had gone moldy was described in the popular newspaper column dear abby . the account has since been circulated widely on the internet as scores of concerned homemakers ponder the safety of the pancake and other baking mixes lurking in their larders : <PARA> there is truth in this tale , yet its inherent warning is overblown . in a nutshell , staledated pancake and other baking mixes pose no danger to you unless : <PARA> how old the mix is has no bearing on its safety — a mix that is well within its freshness date yet has come to contain mold spores could prove fatal to someone with a mold allergy , while one that is a year or two beyond its “ best use by ” date but did not contain mold spores would be perfectly safe . <PARA> while we cannot vet the incident described by “ sue in wyantskill ” involving her 14 - year - old son , the underlying <MASK> is demonstrably <MASK> — it is possible for someone who chows down on pancakes made from a mix that has sat around too long to suffer a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction to the molds that have grown therein . we know this to be so because it has happened before , and the resultant death was documented . <PARA> in 2001 , two pathologists practicing in charleston , south carolina , reported on an unnamed 19 - year - old who died in such a manner . while home on vacation from college , the victim , a young man with a <MASK> of allergies ( including mold ), polished off two pancakes made from a packaged mix that had sat open in a kitchen cabinet for about two years — even though his two friends stopped eating their portions , complaining that the griddlecakes tasted like rubbing alcohol . very quickly thereafter , while watching television , the ill - fated collegian experienced shortness of breath that was not relieved by his inhaler . he asked his friends to take him to a clinic not far from the home , and he was reported to have turned a bit blue from lack of oxygen ( i . e ., became cyanotic ) during the ride . while he did manage to walk into the clinic on his own , once inside he suddenly collapsed in cardiopulmonary arrest . he failed to respond to resuscitative efforts and was pronounced dead . <PARA> the cause of his death was determined to be anaphylaxis due to an allergic reaction to molds . <PARA> anaphylaxis is a rapidly developing immunologic reaction that occurs when those who have allergies come in contact with the substances they are allergic to . when it kills , it does so by triggering fatal respiratory or cardiac arrest . <PARA> the pancake mix that delivered a toxic payload was analyzed and found to contain four rather nasty molds : penicillium , fusarium , mucor , and aspergillus . the decedent had not been allergic to eggs ( which are a component of pancakes ), so there was no doubt as to which allergy had killed him . it had been mold , and nothing but . <PARA> there was a death , and it had been due to ancient pancake mix . or , rather , to an allergic reaction to the mold that had grown in the stale pancake mix . <PARA> it needs be kept in mind there is nothing inherently toxic about pancake mix that has passed its freshness date ; the product ’ s aging does not transform it into a poison , nor does the growth of mold within opened boxes of flapjack powder turn it into something that will fell all who ingest it . only those who have allergies to mold are at risk , and even then , for the pancake mix to pose a hazard it has to contain mold spores , not just be over the hill . <PARA> in october 2008 the pancake mix warning was expanded to include cake , biscuit , and brownie mixes . <PARA> unlike what the e - mailed caution would have folks believe , there is nothing magical about yeast which causes it to “ over time develop spores .” <PARA> for mold to gain access to a food product , the foodstuff has to be exposed to its spores . pancake mix cocooned in an unbleached wax paper , plastic , or a foil pouch within its outer packaging wouldn ’ t have this contact and should still be safe no matter how old it gets . however , mix sold unpouched in cardboard boxes or paper sacks would likely be at risk even if the box or sack hadn ’ t previously been opened , because such packaging would not necessarily keep dampness out , and mold thrives in damp environments . <PARA> what does all this mean ? if you don ’ t have a mold allergy , you needn ’ t fear your pancake mix ; if you do have such a sensitivity , you shouldn ’ t keep your flapjack makings around for a few years after opening the box or pouch it came in . it ’ s not worth dying over 50 ¢ worth of pancake mix , so when in doubt , throw it out .",2006-04-19T07:00:00+00:00

day waiting period comes into play , which the <MORE> benefit to homeowners in filing a written <MASK> before 1 september 2017 : <PARA> again , however , this benefit only accrues if the homeowner later decides to sue the insurance company . <PARA> under current law , pierce says , an insurance company would have to pay 18 percent interest on whatever they owed in the event that a consumer successfully sues them for a delayed payment . under the new law , she points out , companies would have to pay a lower rate of interest arrived at by adding 5 percent to the interest rate determined under sec . 304 . 003 , financial code ( sec . 2c ). <PARA> so there is a potential benefit in filing a <MASK> before 1 september 2017 , but only if you then later file a successful lawsuit in the event of a dispute over your payment . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> the new law will not have a direct effect on insurance <MASK> that are settled out of court , and most insurance <MASK> are settled out of court . however , the law could make it slower and more difficult for homeowners to get paid what they believe they are owed if they start litigation after 1 september 2017 . it will also make suing insurance companies more financially risky . <PARA> if a consumer were to file a lawsuit against their insurance company before 1 september , they could experience a significant benefit from having done so . however , if their home has been extensively damaged just before 1 september 2017 ( by historically catastrophic flooding , for example ), it is extremely unlikely they would be able , practically speaking , to find and hire an attorney and file a suit before 1 september . <PARA> they would also have to have a reasonable basis to sue — a dispute over their <MASK> , or an insurance company ’ s refusal to pay , for example — a process that there simply wasn ’ t time for between the arrival of tropical storm harvey on 26 august and the enactment of the new law on 1 september . <PARA> the only potential benefit from filing a <MASK> before 1 september is that if someone later decides to sue the insurance company and wins , the company will be obliged to pay them the higher , pre - september rate of interest on what they owe . <PARA> the <MASK> contained in viral facebook posts on 27 august 2017 are a largely accurate description of the provisions of hb 1774 , but they do lack important context and do not make it clear to readers that the law only affects how <MASK> are dealt with in the event that someone decides to sue an insurance company . these posts do not include that most insurance <MASK> are settled out of court , and will therefore not be directly affected by the change in the law .",2017-08-28T22:17:32+00:00

misinfo,"what could possibly be behind a <MASK> like this ? <PARA> <MASK> : the <MASK> of a ban on recreational fishing in the u . s . took flight after the publication of a 10 march 2010 editorial on the espn web site which suggested that the obama administration ’ s decision to end the public input phase for zoning issues under consideration by the interagency ocean policy task force “ could prohibit u . s . citizens from fishing some of the nation ’ s oceans , coastal areas , great lakes , and even inland waters .” <PARA> the interagency ocean policy task force was created to develop “ a recommendation for a national policy that ensures protection , maintenance , and restoration of oceans , our coasts and the great lakes . it will also recommend a framework for <PARA> improved stewardship , and effective coastal and marine spatial planning .” the task force has been considering subjects such as how commercial and recreational fishing impacts the environment in the waters within and around the u . s . and how to develop policies that balance fishing industry needs with prudent stewardship of those waters and the aquatic life they harbor . issues such as industrial over - harvesting or other fishing practices ( both commercial and recreational ) that threaten or endanger particular species of fish are matters for consideration by the task force . <PARA> the christian science monitor noted , for example , that : <PARA> the obama administration has proposed using united nations - guided principles to expand a type of zoning to coastal and even some inland waters . that ’ s raising concerns among fishermen that their favorite fishing holes may soon be off - limits for bait - casting . in the battle of incremental change that epitomizes the american conservation movement , many weekend anglers fear that the obama administration ’ s promise to “ fundamentally change ” water management in the us will erode what they call the public ’ s “ right to fish ,” in turn creating economic losses for the $ 82 billion recreational fishing industry and a further deterioration of the american outdoorsman ’ s legacy . proponents say the interagency ocean policy task force established by president obama last june will ultimately benefit the fishing public by managing ecosystems in their entirety rather than by individual uses such as fishing , shipping , or oil exploration . “ it ’ s not an environmentalist manifesto ,” says larry crowder , a marine biologist at duke university in north carolina . “ it ’ s multiple - use planning for the environment , and making sure various uses ... are sustainable .” <PARA> mr . obama has said he will not override protections put in place by presidents clinton and bush that established recreational fishermen as a special class . <PARA> mr . obama has said he will not override protections put in place by presidents clinton and bush that established recreational fishermen as a special class . <PARA> it ’ s not possible to predict at this point exactly what the policies the interagency ocean policy task force will recommend , but those recommendations will almost certainly be aimed primarily at the commercial fishing industry rather than recreational fishermen ;

info,"it may be hard to imagine for those who have grown up in the modern era of radio and television with its “ shock jocks ” and numerous programs involving hosts playing all sorts of bizarre ( and sometimes outright cruel ) pranks on unsuspecting participants , but back in 1965 an off - the - cuff joke by children ’ s television host soupy sales touched off a huge scandal over what would today seem like little more than a harmless prank : <PARA> examples : <PARA> the controversy began on friday , 1 january 1965 , when soupy sales — who was somewhat miffed at having to work on new year ’ s day — had a few minutes to kill at the end of his program . ad - libbing , sales looked into the camera and delivered a request to his young viewers to sneak some “ little green pieces of paper ” ( i . e ., currency ) out of their parents ’ wallets and send them to him . ( the show was aired live and no tape of it exists , so a verbatim transcription of what sales actually said is not available .) <PARA> complaints from outraged parents came fast and furious , and the television <MASK> that hosted sales ’ program , wnew - tv in new york , had pulled him off the air by the following monday . ( contrary to common belief , sales wasn ’ t fired over the stunt , nor was his show canceled because of it : he resumed broadcasting two weeks later , and his program ran on wnew for almost another two years .) <PARA> it ’ s easy for those who weren ’ t around back then to be puzzled by the frenzied response to what now seems like a tepid , impulsive gag at worst , but back in 1965 plenty of adults were livid at the thought of a tv personality ’ s crassly manipulating children for commercial gain . as many of sales ’ supporters maintained , though , soupy hadn ’ t really done anything that radio and television pitchmen hadn ’ t already been doing for years : he had simply cut out the middleman by suggesting that children send him money directly rather than exhorting them to buy his sponsors ’ products . hadn ’ t his radio predecessors been just as commercially manipulative when they continually touted the charms of various mediocre products to children , who then pestered their mothers to buy those products solely because the purchases were necessary to obtain a shake - up mug or code - o - graph or whatever geegaw was being plugged on popular kids ’ shows like little orphan annie and captain midnight ? <PARA> if cooler heads had prevailed back in 1965 , adults might have realized that the furor was much ado about nothing . the premise of soupy ’ s stunt was largely untenable , because it required that children mostly too young to understand or appreciate the concept of “ money ” would nonetheless be able to recognize it , surreptitiously remove it from their parents ’ wallets , put it in envelopes with the correct postage and address ( even though soupy hadn ’ t provided an address ), and mail it to him , all without their parents ’ knowledge or assistance . at that age i ’ d have been hard - pressed to successfully mail a postcard to myself without help , and no kid i knew who was mature to enough understand the value of money was about to part with any prized currency by sending it to a tv host who promised nothing in return , no matter how nicely he asked . nonetheless , decades later sloppy historians were still reporting that “ it worked . according to reports it was ‘ the biggest heist since the brink ’ s robbery .'” 1 <PARA> it didn ’ t work . although various accounts credit soupy with having received up to $ 80 , 000 through the mail , sales himself has revealed on numerous occasions that he netted only a few real dollars , along with a lot of play money , green monopoly money , and other forms of fake currency : <PARA> perhaps someone should have been more concerned with the gullibility of parents , not children .",2001-03-20T09:01:01+00:00

( those having momentary trouble grasping the importance of the term ’ s reversal should spend a moment contemplating the difference between ‘ cathouse ’ and ‘ housecat .’) <PARA> the evolution of handicap to include its ‘ physical disability ’ meaning took place over a number of centuries , and it is necessary to delve into the rules of ‘ hand - in - cap ’ <PARA> ( a lottery game from the 1600s ) to gain an understanding of the <MASK> meaning of the word and how from those early beginnings it progressed to emcompass the myriad meanings we now assign to it . <PARA> to play hand - in - cap required three people ; two players and a referee . the game began with all three putting forfeit money into a cap , with ownership of this kitty to be decided by the outcome of the game . each of the two players would then offer up an item he thought the other guy might want . the referee would inspect the items and assign a monetary value to the difference between the worth of the two things , thereby more or less equalizing the transaction . he who offered the lesser - valued item also had to pony up with the amount decreed by the referee . <PARA> once this appraisal was completed , the two players would reach into their pockets to either draw out loose change or not , depending <MORE> the jump from a game ’ s name to ‘ way to equalize a contest ’ from there become synonymous with ‘ imposed impediment ,’ and then just ‘ impediment .’ <PARA> once again , the use of the word expanded : handicap grew from being strictly a sporting term to cascade into the mainstream of the language . divorced of its gaming associations , it came to mean ‘ a physical limitation ,’ an extension of its ‘ impediment ’ meaning . <PARA> a simple timeline of the word ’ s development : <PARA> at no point in the word ’ s <MASK> does ‘ cap in hand ’ surface . as <MASK> above , it developed by a different route . it also means something entirely different . <PARA> ‘ cap in hand ’ comes to us from the custom of uncovering the head as a sign of reverence , respect , or courtesy . its earliest sighting dates to 1565 where it referred to a show of subservience made to a judge . its shift from a sign of respect ( similar to addressing a gentleman as “ sir ”) to a term meaning ‘ to importune another for a favor ’ is less simple to date accurately . its first clear use in this context occurs in 1887 , but earlier oxford english dictionary entries could be parsed as supporting this meaning . <PARA> nowadays ‘ cap in hand ’ has dropped its <MASK> meaning of ‘ a sign of reverence , respect , or courtesy ’ and has solely come to mean ‘ to humbly seek a favor .’ ( one is said to go ‘ cap in hand ’ to one ’ s boss when asking for a raise , for instance .) <PARA> as to why some choose to believe in a provably <MASK> etymology of handicap that asserts it has ties to the disabled having to subsist as beggars in times past , one can only speculate it has to do with recent abhorrence for handicapped as a description of the disabled . some elements of current society choose to stress abilities over shortcomings , thus terms that identify the disabled as lacking something the abled possess have fallen out of favor with them . handicapped is seen as offensive by some because it stresses the negative , possibly leading to a continued view of the disabled as less than worthy members of the human race . likewise , disabled is also seen as offensive to some who prefer the more ability - positive term less abled . <PARA> what has this to do with a <MASK> etymology ? well , it ’ s far easier to convince folks to eschew a word if it can be tied to an offensive image than it is to get them to swear it off based on mere preference for something else . <PARA> barbara “ beggars description , doesn ’ t it ?” mikkelson",-0001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00

( folklorist gary fine says , “ americans see mexico as both an underdeveloped nation — an exotic location filled with danger and poverty — and recently as an economic rival .”) <PARA> getting back to the beer aspects , among suds drinkers a common insult to hurl at a disappointing brew is to <MASK> it “ tastes like warm piss .” ( how these aficionados would know what warm piss tastes like doesn ’ t bear speculating upon .) the connection between beer and urine is twofold : the color of both liquids , plus the causal relationship between the drinking of one to the need to release the other . in corona ’ s case , believability is further enhanced by the foaminess of the beverage and how the clear glass bottles showcase the beer ’ s yellow color . all beer may be yellow , but only corona visually reminds buyers of this fact even as it passively sits in the bottle . <PARA> though the slander generally adheres only to corona , its theme is jokingly referred to in other bits of popular lore . a long - circulated bit of xeroxlore shows a horse drinking out of a bucket labelled “ coors ” and simultaneously pissing into one marked “ budweiser ”. such snippets lack the malice of the corona <MASK> in that they are framed in such a way no one could take them seriously and are thus clearly intended as humor . by contrast , the <MASK> about corona was not presented in a joking fashion — it was an effective slander passed in whispered tones into cupped ears . <PARA> barbara “ at lagerheads with the competition ” mikkelson <PARA> sightings : one of the plot threads in an episode of l . a . law (“ urine trouble now ,” <MASK> air date 11 may 1989 ) has the law firm defending a mexican brewery being maligned by a ‘ urine in beer ’ <MASK> spread by one of its anglo competitors .",2011-05-27T01:27:06+00:00

misinfo,"whether modern depictions of the appearance of jesus are historically accurate has long been a subject of debate , and one <MASK> related to that debate holds that the modern image of jesus is largely based on the appearance of cesare borgia , a 15th century italian nobleman . <PARA> <MASK> about cesare borgia ’ s likeness forming the basis for all modern depictions of jesus are scattered . an online “ encyclopedia ” of dubious merit asserts the <MASK> as a “ little known fact ,” crediting french novelist alexandre dumas for the notion that borgia “ influenced many images of jesus christ painted during and subsequent to his career .” <PARA> dumas was , while celebrated , a writer of fiction and not an historian . the <MASK> is frequently attributed to “ volume i ” of dumas ’ celebrated crimes ( the borgias ), but we were unable to locate an expression of it in that essay . <PARA> myriad online image macros assert that borgia ’ s father “ forced ” his son ’ s visage into art <MASK> ( a <MASK> offered as an irony given that the borgia family were supposedly “ not christ - like ”), but no <MASK> ever accompanies such assertions : <PARA> such images imply that the relatively standardized , modern depiction of jesus emerged in approximately 1490 , but art historians might argue otherwise . although the renaissance produced a vast quantity of the most prominent depictions of jesus , plenty of artworks antedating 1490 bear the same visual qualities that were purportedly based on those of borgia : <PARA> contrary to <MASK> that jesus ’ now - common characteristics emerged in 1490 , artworks from the middle ages and early renaissance depicted jesus in very much the same way that later artworks did . giotto di bondone ’ s well - known 1305 mural the lamentation of christ features a white man with long brown hair , and sandro botticelli ’ s 1487 madonna of the pomegranate depicts a similarly featured infant christ . hieronymus bosch ’ s ecce homo also antedates 1490 but demonstrates a recognizably familiar jesus , as does duccio di buoninsegna ’ s early 1300 ’ s christ ’ s farewell to his apostles ( and other works ) and bondone ’ s contemporaneous last supper ( a very commonly depicted scene across time ). <PARA> the similarities in jesus ’ image extend to other regions and movements , with flemish renaissance depictions antedating 1490 but still fitting the common pattern . a long haired , pale - skinned jesus was observed in artworks from 1250 and centuries prior . clearly , 1490 was in no way the year , or even the millennium , in which the most common characteristics of jesus ’ depiction in art were solidified . moreover , limitations in the transmission of ideas and trends in that era was such that ; the establishment of a “ new jesus ” would have taken years to propagate across countries and cultures in europe . <PARA> many image macros assert that cesare borgia was the son of a corrupt gangster , a criminal , a dictator , and a sexual deviant . although borgia is historically established as one of the likely illegitimate children of pope alexander vi ( born rodrigo borgia ), reference works describe the elder borgia as a controversial pope but not a “ gangster .” it ’ s widely held that pope alexander vi ’ s checkered reign led in part to the backlash heralding the protestant reformation , but historical literature doesn ’ t describe him as a “ dictator .” as for cesare borgia himself , he was born in 1476 and died at the age of 31 in 1507 , so had his image been used as the model for jesus in artworks created in or before 1490 , those works would have been based on the features of a young teenager . <PARA> cesare borgia of course lived centuries before the advent of cameras , so the most common image we have of borgia now is a portrait of disputed provenance : <PARA> the scant record includes another portrait which bears no noteworthy resemblance to either contemporaneous 15th century or modern depictions of jesus : <PARA> in 2001 forensic anthropologist richard neave created a model of a galilean man for a bbc documentary , son of god , working on the basis of an actual skull found in the region . neave did not <MASK> his model showed jesus ’ s face but rather offered it as a means of prompting people to consider a jesus who looked like a man of his time and place , since the bible does not describe jesus as having distinctive features : <PARA> much like conspiracy theories based primarily on modern photographs , the <MASK> that depictions of jesus <MASK> with a portrait of borgia appear to hinge almost entirely on negligible visual similarities in multiple artworks and the efficacy of suggestion . <PARA> no specific painting is routinely cited as one for which cesare borgia purportedly sat as a model ( or which he inspired ), and oddly enough , the image most commonly associated with this <MASK> was painted in 1940 and bears no resemblance to the few extant borgia portraits . <PARA> the <MASK> about borgia and jesus is possibly a distant variant of old and long - circulating <MASK> that renaissance artist michaelangelo buonarroti ’ s famed sistine chapel ceiling contains “ easter eggs ” evidencing covert motives or illustrating grudges on the artist ’ s part .",2017-01-03T16:50:19+00:00

like popping noise that filled the entire auditorium . the orchestra immediately stopped playing and the audience held its collective breath . the assumption was he would have to put on his braces , pick up his crutches , and leave the stage . either that or someone would have to come out with another string or replace the violin . after a brief pause , perlman set his violin under his chin and signaled to the conductor to begin . <PARA> one person in the audience reported what happened : “ i know it is impossible to play a violin concerto with only three strings . i know that and so do you , but that night , isaac perlman refused to know it . you could see him modulating , changing , and recomposing in his head . at one point it sounded as if he were re - tuning the strings to get a new sound that had never been heard before . when he finished , there was an awesome silence that filled the room . then people rose and cheered . perlman smiled , wiped his brow , and raised the bow of his violin to quiet them . he spoke , not boastfully , but quietly in a pensive tone , ‘ you know , sometimes it is the artist ’ s task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left .'” <PARA> this version is slightly more credible in that it has perlman continuing on three strings after one broke “ in the middle of the performance ” rather than “ just as he finished the first few bars ,” but such an occurrence would still be extraordinary enough to draw the attention of the media , and we haven ’ t found any indication that it did . so , we ’ re left with a <MASK> of anecdotal <MASK> which includes a moral typical of so many fabricated , glurgy tales : just as the damaged violin , crippled by the lack of a string , can still produce beautiful music , so can the “ damaged ” itzhak perlman , crippled by polio , still play the violin with “ such power and purity as the world has never heard before .”",2010-01-11T17:14:36+00:00

misinfo,"<MASK> : although influenza is no longer the unchecked grim reaper of years past ( in 1918 it killed half a million americans and twenty million folks worldwide ), it continues to present a very real danger even in these more modern times . according to the centers for disease control ( cdc ), millions of people in the united <MASK> — about 10 % to 20 % of u . s . residents — will get the flu each year . influenza also costs americans $ 10 billion annually in lost wages and medical expenses . worst of all , every year about 36 , 000 people in the united <MASK> die from it , and 114 , 000 have to be admitted to the hospital because of it . the flu is not just a week of feeling lousy and missing work ; it is a disease that can , has , and does kill . <PARA> some people are more vulnerable to the ravages of the flu than others , which is why those who are most at risk need to be shielded from its contagion . folks 65 years old and up , very young children , and those of any age who have chronic medical conditions need to be vaccinated annually against the flu . however , even those who aren ’ t especially young , old , or <PARA> infirm should get that annual vaccination because avoiding the flu also means sidestepping many dangerous complications such as bacterial pneumonias , ear and sinus infections , and even heart disease and strokes . yet it remains a sad fact that only a handful of people think to do this . worse , their personal aversion is carried over to those they are responsible for : a parent who does not herself get an annual flu shot is far less likely to seek one for her child , even for one in the highest risk group . flu vaccines have been available for many years , yet only 9 % to 25 % of children and young people with asthma get flu shots , and young asthmatics are one of the groups most at risk . <PARA> cost , inconvenience , and dread of injection keep people from availing themselves of this preventive . the stumbling blocks of cost and inconvenience are being eroded , however : the price of a flu shot is down to $ 17 , and inject ‘ n ’ go <MASK> spring up in pharmacies and other locations every october and november , so it ’ s no longer a question of having to make an appointment with the family doctor and take time off from work to keep it . but a needle is still a needle . <PARA> aversion to needles explains the appeal of vaccines that are sprayed into the nose : do away with the needle , and more people will choose to guard themselves from the <MORE> drive to have everyone vaccinated against influenza as “ motivated purely by economics ” when such an initiative could easily prevent most of those deaths strikes many as flat - out wrong . <PARA> it is <MASK> flumist ’ s manufacturer , medimmune vaccines , and its marketer , wyeth vaccines , have been advertising the intranasal vaccine heavily , especially in television ads . they ’ ve a product to sell , and they ’ re intent upon selling it . but it can also be reasonably concluded that the availability of a non - injected flu vaccine will motivate many who would otherwise have gone unprotected to guard themselves against a disease that kills . people do fear needles , and their trepidation influences them to delay or entirely eschew vaccination . take away the needle , and more will seek out the vaccine . <PARA> some sources suggest flumist will result in a protection against the flu virus that will last far longer than the protection imparted by injected vaccines , but this <MASK> has yet to be fully substantiated . however , if this does prove to be the case , it would become a strong argument in the favor of the nasally - delivered protectant , because a traditional flu vaccination given in october can lose its effectiveness by march , leaving its host vulnerable to infection . the buzz about flumist suggests its protection will last a full year . ( repeated vaccinations are necessary to protect against new strains of the flu , and because the body ’ s immunity to the flu declines over time .) <PARA> there is a risk that a small number of those who avail themselves of the intranasal vaccine will pass the live virus used in it to others , but is there not a far greater danger presented by those whose fear of needles keeps them from getting vaccinated ? they catch the flu , and they pass it to others , with the contagion so transmitted living on through their victims to infect even more . vaccine , no matter how delivered , can stop the spread of virus . <PARA> barbara “ marriage does not have to mean ‘ what ’ s mine is yours '” mikkelson <PARA> update : as of mid - november 2003 , medimmune had sold only 400 , 000 doses of flumist and estimated that 50 to 80 per cent of those doses might be returned unused . the primary factors behind the low sales figures were retail giant wal - mart ’ s canceling plans to offer the vaccine in 1 , 000 of its stores , the fact that members of the target group for whom the fda approved flumist ( healthy people from ages 5 to 49 ) rarely get flu shots , and consumer reluctance to spend several times more than the cost of a conventional flu shot in order to avoid a needle .",2009-08-28T15:32:12+00:00

( the facebook post confusingly referred to a “ card reader ” rather than a “ card skimmer .”) <PARA> when a customer inserts a card into the reader , the transaction takes place as normal and the customer ’ s card is debited , but the skimmer also extracts all the relevant data from the magnetic stripe on the card , including the credit card number , expiry date , and security code . <PARA> the thieves who planted the skimmer can then return to the machine and use a bluetooth transmitter to transfer all the stored credit card details from the skimmer to a storage device such as a mobile phone or laptop , all without having to physically remove the skimmer . <PARA> bluetooth technology <PARA> not all credit card skimmers operate using bluetooth technology in this way , but many do , and this use of bluetooth technology is what leaves the skimmers vulnerable to detection . we asked nick poole , an electronics expert at the hobby electronics company sparkfun and co - creator of the “ skimmer scanner ” android app , to outline how they work . <PARA> poole explained that he and his colleagues were consulted by local law enforcement in colorado after a wave of credit card skimmer thefts at gas <MASK> in 2017 and were able to reverse engineer some of the skimmers removed from the pumps , adding that : <PARA> when poole and his colleagues worked with police in colorado in 2017 , they found that the majority of credit card skimmers that employed bluetooth technology used bluetooth modules called hc - 05 or hc - 06 . poole told us he was informed at that time that the hc - 05 and hc - 06 modules had been widely encountered by law enforcement in skimmers across the united <MASK> , though they were by no means the only kind of bluetooth module used in credit card skimmers . <PARA> so even without using poole ’ mobile app <MORE> scanners could be a useful way to counteract the threat posed by credit card skimmers but also acknowledged their limitations , writing in an email that they “ can help but they aren ’ t <MASK> ”: <PARA> “ criminals are always trying to make the skimmers harder to spot . there are several other low - cost bluetooth modules in the same category as the hc - 05 , so this app [ skimmer scanner ] won ’ t detect all types of skimmers .” <PARA> nunnikhoven recommended two additional precautions that customers could take if they were concerned about credit card skimmers at gas <MASK> pumps : <PARA> “ first , a physical check . does the keypad or credit card slot look well maintained and well fitted to the pump ? does it match the next pump ? secondly , monitor your credit card <MASK> for suspicious charges . as long as you aren ’ t negligent with your credit card and pin ( if you have one ), the protections provided by the credit card company ensure that if you do get skimmed , it ’ s only an annoyance ( changing all your billing info ) and not a financial catastrophe .” <PARA> brian krebs , a leading cybersecurity reporter , told us that bluetooth detection such as that employed in the skimmer scanner app was useful in revealing one kind of credit card skimmer , but he recommended that consumers check the physical appearance of the gas pump reader instead : <PARA> “ overall , consumers are better off looking for <MASK> that use more modern pumps that include new security features ( no master key to rule them all , putting sensitive components in locked , steel cages inside the locked pump , point - to - point encryption , etc .). consumers can tell them apart simply by looking for pumps that have horizontal card readers and a raised keypad .” <PARA> on the whole , the viral february 2019 facebook post was a fairly crude explanation of what is nonetheless a real phenomenon . a mobile phone ’ s bluetooth sensor can indeed be used to scan for and detect certain bluetooth modules known to be used in credit card skimmers . <PARA> what the facebook post did not make clear is that not every “ sequence of letters ” or “ sequence of numbers ” on a mobile phone ’ s bluetooth device list means a customer is in the presence of a credit card skimmer , nor will a mobile phone ’ s bluetooth sensor successfully identify every credit card skimmer in use in gas pumps and atms across the united <MASK> . <PARA> the mobile phone bluetooth scanner is a potentially useful way to lower the risk of exposure to some popular kinds of credit card skimmers , but it is not fool - <MASK> , and it is prone to both <MASK> negatives and <MASK> positives .",2019-02-20T00:29:05+00:00

( because the federal government has fallen short in tracking such killings , volunteers have stepped up to the plate with databases like killed by police and fatal encounters .) <PARA> according to the hennepin county medical examiner ’ s office , damond did die from a gunshot wound to the abdomen , and her death was ruled a homicide . but contradicting the suspicion that damond was the target of an assassination due to her alternative health practices , she herself dialed 911 at 11 : 30 p . m ., because she heard what she believed to be a sexual assault outside her minneapolis , minnesota home — and her call for emergency services ended with her death . <PARA> according to the minneapolis bureau of criminal apprehension , which is investigating the incident , two minneapolis police department officers , matthew harrity and mohamed noor , responded to the call . harrity was driving and noor was in the passenger seat . according to the bca ’ s preliminary investigation , harrity said he was startled by a loud noise just as damond approached the squad car . noor opened fire through harrity ’ s open driver ’ s side window , striking damond in the abdomen . <PARA> further contradicting the notion that damond ’ s death was an assassination , both officers tried to revive her . they “ immediately exited the squad and provided medical attention until medical personnel arrived ,” according to the bca . <PARA> the case is part of an ongoing — and wrenching — public discourse over police killings . neither harrity or noor ’ s body cameras filmed the shooting , nor did the squad car ’ s camera . police killings of people like philando castile , eric garner , mike brown , manuel diaz , and kelly thomas have resulted in civil unrest in recent years . <PARA> almost exactly one year before damond ’ s death , st . anthony , minnesota police officer jeromino yanez killed philando castile during a traffic stop . castile was a licensed gun owner who had told yanez he had his permitted weapon with him in the car ; he was shot while trying to comply with the officer ’ s orders . the grim aftermath of the shooting was broadcast live on social media by his girlfriend , diamond reynolds , who was in the car with him along with her 4 - year - old daughter . yanez was charged with manslaughter , but was acquitted in june 2017 . <PARA> although questions have been raised in news reports about noor ’ s and yanez ’ s training in relations to the deaths of the two minnesota residents , there is no <MASK> to suggest that “ big pharma ” somehow influenced the two officers who responded to damond ’ s 911 call to target her for assassination in an ongoing conspiracy to kill off holistic healers .",2017-07-25T01:28:34+00:00

misinfo,"everyone in the cleaning industry has always been told that hand dryers in restrooms are not sanitary ; they spread germs and bacteria around . i always thought that this just came from the paper companies because they are loosing sales to the hand dryers . <PARA> a couple of years ago , i was working with a rep , and i noticed that after he washed his hands and noticed that there were no paper towels , only a hand dryer , he left the restroom with wet hands . i asked him about it . he said that hand dryers blow a lot of germs and bacteria around . he also told me to take a look under the hand dryer next time i was in a restroom . <PARA> there is a filter underneath the hand dryer that is supposed to be cleaned on a weekly basis . i looked at one and it looked like it hadn ’ t been cleaned in years . it had layers and layers of caked on gunk ( disgusting ). since then i will not use hand dryers in restrooms . <PARA> now this is where the <MASK> gets really interesting . the schools and universities that have had the h1n1 ( swine flue ) outbreak this year are being told by the health department that they have to take out all of their hand dryers and replace them with towel dispensers because the hand dryers are spreading disease . please pass this along so everyone knows not to use hand dryers . <PARA> <MASK> : this e - mailed alert began circulating in october 2009 . while its central <MASK> that forced air hand dryers spread disease is in dispute , we could find no substantiation for its ancillary assertion that schools and universities where there have been outbreaks of swine flu have been ordered by their local health departments to replace these machines with paper towel dispensers . try as we might , we haven ’ t been able to find any confirmatory information about such institutes of learning being told by anyone ( health department or otherwise ) to remove their forced - air hand dryers . <PARA> indeed , the centers for disease control ( cdc ) recommends in various online publications that public sinks be stocked with paper towels or equipped with hand dryers ( e . g ., its preventing the spread of influenza ( the flu ) in child care settings : guidance for administrators , care providers , and other staff <MASK> : “ ensure that sink locations and restrooms are stocked with soap , paper towels or working hand dryers “). <PARA> regarding the e - mail ’ s central <MASK> about hand dryers contributing to the spread of disease , there ’ s no clear answer to the subject because what little research that has been done <PARA> in this area is disputed . a 2008 - 09 research paper <MORE> hands , since they ’ re not wet to begin with ), but rather of poorly - washed hands . precious few nasty microbes are dislodged by tap water alone : merely rinsing one ’ s hands under running water and then drying them with a blower is doing little other than putting microbe - laden ( albeit wet ) hands in front of a wind generating machine . <PARA> also , of those that use soap in the ablutions , not all that many wash their hands long enough to rid themselves of whatever nasties their hands have accumulated . for handwashing to be effective , folks need to lather up and then scrub for no less than 20 seconds before rinsing ( roughly the same amount of time it takes to twice run through happy birthday to you ). <PARA> those who don ’ t wash all that well or for long enough are putting still - germy hands under a blower . whether germs , microbes , or viruses could be blown off still - wet hands and into the surrounding air by such devices is an unanswered question , though . <PARA> paper towels offer a couple of advantages that electric hand dryers do not . since their use is frictional ( you rub your hands with them ), the act of drying with them can aid in the removal of some bacteria . also , given that the four most microbe - laden areas of public restrooms are the toilet , the floor around it , the counter area , and door and flush handles , using a paper towel on the door handle when exiting the restroom rather than handling it directly can keep one from coming into contact with one of microbial “ hot spots ” of such venues . <PARA> however , paper towels also have their microbial downside as used ones are discarded in bins , which means whatever got wiped onto them is now lurking in a communal garbage can , happily multiplying away in that warm , damp environment . <PARA> one downside inherent to hand dryers is that folks tend not to use them correctly . whether it ’ s the noise , or a sense of the user ’ s being made the center of attention , or just the amount of time such air blasting takes , people tend not to keep their hands under the blower until drying is complete , instead preferring to walk away with damp hands .

misinfo,"<MASK> : one of the less appetizing aspects of modern life is having to entrust our personal safety and wellbeing to those responsible for churning out household and personal care items . precious little of the process of bringing these items to market is transparent , and the products that end up in our hands arrive emblazoned with lengthy lists of polysyllabic ingredients that make the task of working out exactly what went into them almost impossible . ultimately , we have to cross our fingers and hope that the manufacturers have done right by us . but even so , there is always that little nagging sense that all might not be entirely well with many of the items we use on a daily basis . <PARA> <MASK> about icky or even dangerous substances lurking in ordinary household and personal products are our way of voicing that sense of disquiet , thus we fret that <PARA> our shampoo causes cancer , our scrubbing sponges contain formaldehyde , and our lipsticks are loaded with lead ( and even go so far as to worry about how much lip goo women swallow in their lifetimes ). we also fret ( needlessly , it turns out ) that our mascara contains bat poop . <PARA> this <MASK> ’ s <MASK> lies with a similarity between two words that causes them to be confused for one another : guano and guanine . <PARA> mascara contains the crystalline form of guanine , a word that derives from the spanish word guano , meaning “ dung .” guanine is used extensively in the cosmetics industry , where it functions as a colorant and as an opacifying ( shimmering or light diffusing ) agent . it ’ s found in bath products , cleansing products , fragrances , hair conditioners , lipsticks , nail products , shampoos and skin care products . the crystalline guanine used in beauty products doesn ’ t derive from excrement , though , either from bats or from any other critter . yet there is a bit of a “ yuck !” factor to that ingredient , as guanine is manufactured from fish scales , which means you ’ re likely finding a little bit of nemo in your cosmetics drawer . <PARA> the personal care products council ( formerly the cosmetic toiletry and fragrance association ) labels the <MASK> about bat guano in mascara as <MASK> : “ the color additive guanine is approved by the fda and listed in the code of federal regulations ,” said that organization ’ s irene malbin . “ by law , guanine must be derived from fish scales . it is not derived from guano . in addition , there are no guano - or feces - based ingredients used in any cosmetics .” <PARA> bat guano has commercial uses , but not in the cosmetics industry . instead , highly regarded fertilizer is made from bat droppings because this type of excrement is incredibly rich in nitrogen .

( social media <MASK> about rudeness to police often seem to quickly follow high profile controversies involving police and race , such as the death of eric garner or the mckinney pool party incident .) <PARA> one thread of that debate suggested that the focus of reactive movements such as “ black lives matter ” was essentially attacking police . in response , on 9 september 2015 facebook user anthony welichko posted the example shown above , proposing an idea to support police that he dubbed the “ safe harbor initiative .” ( the idea later carried over to a number of september 2015 blog posts titled “ have you seen blue strip on curb ? here ’ s the incredible reason behind it .”) <PARA> the “ safe harbor ” proposal is clearly well - intentioned , and the person who asked social media users to share it meant only to encourage a broadly adoptable method of showing support for police officers . however , its functional application is somewhat unsound and ill - suited for the purpose it ’ s supposed to serve . <PARA> one issue with this proposal is that curb markers are often used by agencies such as public works departments to indicate locations work sites or important structural information . one example comes from bozeman , montana , where the very same signal illustrated in the “ safe harbor ” proposal was already in use : <PARA> bozeman is presumably not the only location wherein public works officials utilize painted strips of blue on curbs as internal signals . adopting that system to show moral support for police would create confusion over whether such markings were related to law enforcement protection or infrastructural projects . <PARA> additionally , blue strips painted on curbs are not particularly visible during non - daylight hours . it ’ s not reasonable to expect that police responding to evening or nighttime calls will first examine neighborhood curbsides with their flashlights to determine whether they have any community support in the area . <PARA> another matter is whether or not the proposal is ( or ever will be ) known outside of a few thousand shares on facebook . unless and until it is a widely used ( or at least widely recognized ) system , it will not be recognizable or useful to police . <PARA> finally , any form of reliance on such an informal and <MORE> ) sense of security ? if not , it ’ s unlikely that police would ever gain much benefit or place any reliance on the use of such symbols . <PARA> aside from all of those issues , just how are civilians supposed to provide “ back - up ” or “ have [ an officer ’ s back ]” during a hypothetical adversarial event or crime in progress ? police everywhere ( while typically grateful for public support ) are pretty firm about urging well - meaning civilians not to interfere with law enforcement activities . routinely , cops emphatically request that civilians present at crime scenes assist merely by staying out of the way and closely following their instructions , not by leaping in to serve as untrained “ back - up .” <PARA> police departments across the united <MASK> ( examples here , here , here , here , here , and here [ pdf , pdf ]) are consistent and firm in their guidance on this matter : civilians should not intervene with crimes in progress , especially when police are already on the scene . those who do may end up injured ( potentially fatally ), and untrained intervention poses severe risk to both other civilians and responding officers . this reason alone is enough to be extremely cautious about spreading the “ blue strip ” <MASK> , as the police require cooperation with the commands they ’ ve issued to bystanders more than they need encouragement for the public to act as crime scene cheerleaders . <PARA> while the “ safe harbor initiative ”/ blue strip curb paint idea was one borne of a desire to show support for police , for many reasons the proposed practice is likely to be of negligible benefit to any officers . most important , the message encourages a practice police departments universally disdain : civilian intervention in crimes in progress . well - meaning , untrained civilians who ’ ve taken it upon themselves to “ help ” the police are generally more of a burden and hindrance than anything else , so if you think police might need your help during an event , it ’ s best to wait for them to ask you for assistance . <PARA> it ’ s understandable that folks are moved to give back to hard - working police officers across the country , and one quora user ( who is also a retired cop ) offered a list of safe ways for civilians to do so without interfering with police activity : <PARA> “ slacktivist ” initiatives such as painting blue strips on curbs may give a temporary feeling of accomplishment , but those truly concerned with the plight of police officers would do better to donate to law enforcement charities or volunteer in an official capacity where civilian hands are needed ( and wanted ). last updated : 15 september 2015 <PARA> first published : 15 september 2015",2015-09-15T20:15:37+00:00
